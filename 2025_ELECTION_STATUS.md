  - Richland: 6 races, 17 candidates
- **44 total candidates** across all races
- **23 races** with proper office assignments

### Scripts Created
- `scripts/import/pdc-candidates-2025.ts` - Imports candidates from PDC
- `scripts/import/pamphlet-2025.ts` - Imports photos/statements from voter pamphlet

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### All Candidates Imported
- Initially had 16+ "missing" candidates from voter pamphlet
- Issue: Pamphlet API returned "Unknown Office" for all candidates
- Resolution: Created all candidates and fixed office assignments using race ID mappings
- Result: All 44 candidates now properly imported and assigned

### Photos and Statements
- 25 of 44 candidates have photos (57%)
- 25 of 44 candidates have statements (57%)
- Missing data is for candidates who either:
  - Haven't submitted to voter pamphlet yet
  - Are only in PDC but not pamphlet
  
### Office Assignment Fix
- Problem: 19 candidates were incorrectly assigned to "Unknown Office"
- Solution: Created `fix-candidate-offices.ts` script with proper race-to-office mappings
- Result: All candidates now assigned to correct offices and connected to proper city guides
