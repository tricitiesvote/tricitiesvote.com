### 🛠️ Tools Created

We built reusable utilities in `scripts/utils/`:

- `find-duplicates.ts` - Identifies potential duplicate candidates
- `validate-race-ids.ts` - Validates pamphlet data availability
- `match-pamphlet-candidates.ts` - Matches pamphlet data to candidates

### 🔧 Issues Resolved

1. **Missing Candidates**: Found that pamphlet API returned "Unknown Office" for all candidates
2. **Office Assignments**: Created script to properly assign 19 candidates to their correct offices
3. **Name Mismatches**: Fixed name variations between PDC and pamphlet data
4. **Photo Import**: Successfully imported photos for 25 of 44 candidates
