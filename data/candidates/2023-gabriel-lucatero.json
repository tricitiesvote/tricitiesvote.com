As a parent of four sons and two daughters in the school district,  a community member, I believe the future of our city depends on the ability of our district to bring excellence with equity to all students. This means supporting teachers to do their best work with our kids every day. This means listening to and incorporating the input of teachers, families and community members when designing district policies. And it means holding district leadership accountable when test scores flatline, enrollment fails to meet projections .",
