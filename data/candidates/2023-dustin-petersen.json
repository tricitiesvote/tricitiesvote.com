  "statement": "**Elected Experience**\n\nQuincy City Council (2014-2015)\n\n**Other professional Experience**\n\nColumbia Ag Consultants\n\n**Education**\n\nQuincy High School 2005, BYU-Idaho 2013 BA Political Science\n\n**Community Service**\n\nBoy Scouts of America (Eagle Scout), Youth Football and Baseball Coach\n\n**Statement:**\n\nAs the father of three young children, I have a vested interest to ensure our kids get an exceptional education. Regardless of our political beliefs, we all share a common goal: to provide our children with the best education possible. If elected, I pledge to work collaboratively with my fellow board members. \n\nWe need to support our teachers, paraprofessionals, and administrators. We should allocate resources back into the classroom, support the teachers in maintaining order, and empower them with the tools they need. Let’s focus on real world teaching and civics lessons. I oppose any theories that are critical of any race, because I want all students to feel like they belong.\n\nAs board members it is our job to make sure we are providing the right resources to the right schools. With declining school enrollment prevalent statewide, we must be prudent and fiscally responsible with the funds that we have.\n\nParents matter. I will defend parents’ rights and work to expand parental involvement in our schools. Listening to parents is crucial to the success of any school district. Together let us put our differences aside and focus on what truly matters: the future of our children!",
