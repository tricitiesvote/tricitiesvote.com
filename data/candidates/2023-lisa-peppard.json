Both of my children attended Kennewick schools from the time they were in kindergarten and first grade. During that time I volunteered hundreds of hours in their schools. I have been attending school board meetings for over a decade because I care deeply about all children in my community. This makes me uniquely qualified to become the next Kennewick School Board Director in Position 5.\n\nOne thing we all agree on is that we want our children to thrive. I will work with civility to find a sensible approach to address the issues facing the students and families of the Kennewick School District. Partisanship has no place in our schools. Decisions should be made using the best data available to serve everyone.\n\nThe district has wisely prioritized making students feel safe, known, and valued. The percentage of KSD students reporting that they feel safe continues to fall short of the goal. In order to tackle issues like low graduation rates and performance scores, we must address safety first. My experience as a registered nurse will be a great asset in bringing a compassionate approach to this job.",
