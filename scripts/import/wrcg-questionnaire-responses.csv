Braden Sloughter,1,"Should West Richland adopt a “City Manager” form of government, or retain the “Strong Mayor” form of government that we currently have? Please explain your rationale.","​

I support moving toward a City Manager form of government, but we need to be smart about it. This is a major change that should be implemented thoughtfully, with community input, a clear plan, and a focus on improving efficiency, accountability, and transparency without creating unnecessary costs or bureaucracy.

Braden Sloughter,2,The West Richland Mayor currently has sole discretion over hiring and salary decisions for City Staff. Should that continue or should hiring and salary decisions require concurrence with the City Council?,"I believe in checks and balances. The Mayor should have flexibility for day-to-day staffing, but major hires and significant salary changes should involve Council oversight. That balance keeps decision-making efficient while ensuring accountability.

​​",https://www.wrcg.org/bradensloughter
Braden Sloughter,3,Should there be a succession plan for key city staff positions?,"Absolutely. Succession planning ensures continuity, stability, and preparedness when key positions become vacant. It’s about avoiding disruption and making sure the city runs smoothly, no matter what.

Braden Sloughter,4,"What are your favorite aspects of West Richland and what do you think draws people to our City? Alternatively, what are your leading concerns?","I love West Richland’s small-town character, safety, parks, and the way neighbors know each other. People come here for space, community, and quality of life. My biggest concern is unmanaged growth. If we don’t plan for it properly, we risk losing the very things that make West Richland special.

Braden Sloughter,5,How should current and future City Park development and maintenance be funded? Should the City establish a Parks & Recreation department or contract for private companies to provide those services? Should future neighborhood parks be maintained through HOA funding?,"I’m open to creating a Parks & Recreation department if it makes sense financially and operationally for West Richland. If an HOA wants to go above and beyond the required parks, I think it’s a great asset for their neighborhood to add additional park and open space that they maintain. The big concern for me is making sure we have enough city-owned public parks that are accessible to everyone, along with the resources and staffing to properly maintain and manage them. Public-private partnerships can also play a role in keeping costs down while maintaining quality.

Braden Sloughter,6,How would you improve communication between the City Council and citizens? Should more time be given for people to speak at City Council meetings? Should there be more open workshops for citizens to attend? Other suggestions?,"​

Yes to all of it. I’d like to see more open workshops, town halls, and online Q&As, plus extended public comment time when needed. We also need plain language updates online and on social media so residents can easily understand the issues and how to get involved. A more accessible, easier-to-navigate city website with important information clearly posted and easy to find would make a big difference in keeping residents informed. I’d also like to see easy to understand explanations of city processes, zoning rules, timelines, and other procedures posted so citizens who want to be involved know how and when to participate.

​​",https://www.wrcg.org/bradensloughter
Braden Sloughter,7,"What is your position on allowing adult-only businesses such as adult entertainment, casinos, etc. within City limits?","Let’s address the elephant in the room, we all know cannabis stores are the hot topic in this conversation. Right now, there’s a cannabis store surrounded by city limits that we don’t collect a dime of tax revenue from. Looking at recent state data, cannabis sales are actually falling statewide, back to pre-pandemic levels, so this is starting to feel like an issue with more hype than an actual wave of new stores we need to worry about.

​

When it comes to other “adult-only” businesses, the label covers a wide range, from winery tasting rooms to pubs to strip clubs. Those are very different things. Casinos and strip clubs don’t fit West Richland’s family-focused community values. But a winery tasting room? That aligns with our local wine industry and tourism economy. Any decision should be based on the type of business, whether it fits our community character, and what it contributes to West Richland.

Braden Sloughter,8,What is your position on permitting firework sales and use within West Richland city limits? Should Municipal Code Section 8.22; “Fireworks” and Section 9.38; “Noise Regulation” be amended to be consistent?,"​

I love the 4th of July, but I also recognize the real fire danger in our dry, windy summers, and we all saw what happened this year. A total ban isn’t realistic without strong enforcement, but we can make fireworks safer by limiting the days and hours they’re allowed, enforcing penalties for reckless use, and aligning the fireworks and noise codes so they’re consistent and enforceable.

​​",https://www.wrcg.org/bradensloughter
Braden Sloughter,9,What can City government do to improve transparency with the public when it comes to spending and other critical City decisions?,"Be proactive and clear. Share important information before votes happen, not after. Provide easy to read summaries of budgets, projects, and decisions without all the government jargon. Livestream and archive meetings so anyone can watch anytime. The City’s website should be more accessible and easier to navigate, with straightforward explanations of processes, zoning rules, timelines, and decision points so residents know how and when to get involved.

​​​",https://www.wrcg.org/bradensloughter
Braden Sloughter,10,"What can be done to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse of our City tax dollars?","​

Regular independent audits, competitive bidding for contracts, strong internal controls, and whistleblower protections are key. And we should always treat the city’s budget like it’s our own household budget making sure every dollar is used responsibly. If people believe there’s a lot of waste, fraud, and abuse happening, maybe it’s time to elect someone new to council. 😉

David Cole,1,"Should West Richland adopt a “City Manager” form of government, or retain the “Strong Mayor” form of government that we currently have? Please explain your rationale.","​

I support moving to a Council-Manager form of city government. The current strong mayor model is no longer sustainable. It relies on a mayor without the skills needed to run the city. I do not support a hybrid City Administrator system. It failed when tried before. West Richland is poised for substantial growth, potentially increasing by 8-10,000 in population over the next 10 years. We need a professional city manager who has the education, training, knowledge, skills and experience for the job – one who will collaborate with council, empower city staff, and hold him/herself accountable to citizens and council. I believe the cost of a competent city manager salary will easily offset the costs associated with serious past mistakes, pending lawsuits, etc.

David Cole,2,The West Richland Mayor currently has sole discretion over hiring and salary decisions for City Staff. Should that continue or should hiring and salary decisions require concurrence with the City Council?,"The mayor should rely on the “advice & consent” function of Council, especially in hiring department heads and/or confirming appointments, budget development, and salary determination. As the chief executive of the city in our current system, the mayor has authority for hiring/firing and salary determinations.

​​",https://www.wrcg.org/davidcole
David Cole,3,Should there be a succession plan for key city staff positions?,"​​

Yes. Every successful organization has a succession plan for replacing talent to ensure continuity of operations and reliability of leadership. Succession planning is a requirement in many cities and in most major businesses.

​

​​4) What are your favorite aspects of West Richland and what do you think draws people to our City? Alternatively, what are your leading concerns?

My favorite aspect of West Richland is definitely the people.I chose to live here 20 years ago and have never regretted it.We appreciate our small-town vibe and family-friendly neighborhoods, yet we recognize the need to accommodate growth.My leading concerns are a lack of transparency in city government, the need for a healthy business climate and lack of citizen involvement. My priorities are:

Increased transparency in city government

Greater citizen involvement in policy, planning and budget decisions

Strengthen family-friendly neighborhoods

Minimize tax increases

Promote a healthy and profitable environment for businesses

Support continued growth and provide essential city services

Encourage continued development of middle housing

Support our police officers and first responders

Promote a drug-free community and focus on crime prevention

Enhance senior citizen and veteran support efforts

David Cole,5,How should current and future City Park development and maintenance be funded? Should the City establish a Parks & Recreation department or contract for private companies to provide those services? Should future neighborhood parks be maintained through HOA funding?,"Our parks are a great feature and we should continue to maintain them well. I do not support creating a Parks & Rec department. Maintenance of existing city parks should be provided by contracting with local business. The city currently contracts essential services such as fire/EMS (Benton Co Fire Dist. 4), sanitation/garbage service (Basin Disposal), and library services (Mid Columbia Library) to name a few. Future park maintenance options include HOA provisions as was recently approved by the city with the developer, neighborhood park associations with city oversight, and corporate sponsorships.

David Cole,6,How would you improve communication between the City Council and citizens? Should more time be given for people to speak at City Council meetings? Should there be more open workshops for citizens to attend? Other suggestions?,"​

Communication is essential in all levels of government but especially at the local level. Successful businesses make great efforts to communicate with the communities they serve because customers insist on it. The market demands it. City government has customers too – the citizens who pay the bills. Active listening is an essential skill for council members. The city should continue to encourage citizen participation in Council meetings. No citizen should be made to feel they won’t be heard and no citizen should be restricted to “free speech zones” in order to exercise their God-given (and Constitutionally protected) right to speak their conscience.

​​",https://www.wrcg.org/davidcole
David Cole,7,"What is your position on allowing adult-only businesses such as adult entertainment, casinos, etc. within City limits?","I do not support these types of businesses in our city. They are completely contrary to the city’s vision statement, which reads: “West Richland is a growing city where family values and community responsiveness are important. The city should grow in a balanced way to produce a safe and inviting community having good residential and recreation alternatives and a healthy economic base.” I agree with and support that vision. The purported revenue for the city from these businesses rarely reaches the levels claimed. The potential threat to public safety and harm to families is virtually incalculable.

David Cole,8,What is your position on permitting firework sales and use within West Richland city limits? Should Municipal Code Section 8.22; “Fireworks” and Section 9.38; “Noise Regulation” be amended to be consistent?,"​

I have yet to meet anyone in West Richland who is ambivalent on this issue, with folks tending to either strongly support fireworks or strongly oppose them. WRMC 8.22 is well-written and very prescriptive. It considers the need for public safety and the citizens’ desire for fireworks. It adopts the standards of the WA State Fire Marshal’s Office and even contains provisions for suspension of fireworks use, recovery of costs associated with fireworks response, prohibits property damage due to fireworks, and prohibits fireworks in parks or private property without consent of the property owner. The types of fireworks allowed/prohibited are also listed. Chapter 9.38 is equally prescriptive and provides exemptions for events with substantial public participation like community celebrations, festivals, parades, etc. As a Navy veteran and former sworn law enforcement officer, I support maximum freedom with maximum responsibility. A complete fireworks ban is unreasonable. A complete fireworks free-for-all is equally unreasonable. I believe reasonable people do reasonable things. We don’t need more laws or rules on this issue. A reasonable solution with respect to fireworks can be reached. I support Chapters 8.22 and 9.39 as they are currently written and encourage all citizens to familiarize themselves with both. Our solution to the fireworks quarrel is there.

David Cole,9,What can City government do to improve transparency with the public when it comes to spending and other critical City decisions?,"The city should invite public input through increased citizen interaction, open Q&A, workshops, and expanding opportunities for public comment.

​​​",https://www.wrcg.org/davidcole
David Cole,10,"What can be done to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse of our City tax dollars?","​

Every single member of city government – council, mayor, city staff – has a fiduciary responsibility to the people who are paying the bills – the taxpaying citizens. We aren’t Shark Tank, we shouldn’t invest in start-ups. City funds should not be used in ventures like the super car facility and similar endeavors. I support an independent, unaffiliated DOGE-style review to provide confidence to citizens that our tax money is being spent correctly.

CANDIDATE RESUME",https://www.wrcg.org/davidcole
Fred Brink,1,"Should West Richland adopt a “City Manager” form of government, or retain the “Strong Mayor” form of government that we currently have? Please explain your rationale.","​

West Richland cannot simply “adopt” a City Manager form of government. Such change requires a majority vote of the people. In general, this process may be initiated either by a resolution adopted by the city council or by a petition process, both of which are then followed by an election on the issue of reorganizing under a different form of government.

Further, while our neighboring cities (Pasco, Kennewick and Richland) utilize the City Manager form of government, it is not the most prevalent local government structure in our state. The “strong mayor” structure, or Mayor-Council, is the oldest and most common form of government in Washington, utilized by small towns and large cities alike. In fact, 228 cities, or more than 81 percent, of Washington cities, presently use the Mayor-Council form of government while only 53 cities in our state, or less than 19 percent, have adopted the City Manager governance structure.

Many Mayor-Council cities often hire professional city administrators to serve under the mayor. A city administrator is usually a full-time position responsible for many administrative and policy-related duties such as budget preparation, personnel administration, and department supervision. This model retains a separately elected mayor who is ultimately responsible for administration of the city, while providing for professional management of the city's day-to-day operations. In theory, a city administrator allows the mayor to focus greater attention on policy development, political leadership, and less on general administrative and operational matters.

However, regardless of whether a city administrator is hired or the city manager form of government is adopted, the cost to our taxpayers will be substantial – IN EXCESS OF $200,000 EACH YEAR FOR SALARY AND BENEFITS. This cost does not even include the added expense of the election necessary to change our form of government to City Manager.

The amount of tax money needed to staff either of these positions simply does not exist in your city’s general fund budget without making dramatic cuts in other areas, such as closing neighborhood parks, further reducing road repair efforts or laying off city staff. Even if our city had an “extra” $200,000 to spend every year, this money would be better directed toward hiring more police officers, several parks maintenance staff or a number of other critically needed personnel. Once you cut through the rhetoric on this issue, it is clear the most prudent and fiscally responsible decision is to elect a mayor who is fully capable of managing city staff from Day One and ensuring essential city services are delivered in a cost-effective manner.

In addition to already possessing decades of proven public sector management and leadership experience, I will discuss with city council and our citizens possible future funding of a city administrator position as part of my succession planning as mayor. This choice represents the most widely used city management structure, the most expedient to adopt, and the least expensive option for our taxpayers as no election is required. Nevertheless, the final decision ultimately rests with the city council as your councilmembers must also approve funding this position (or a city manager position) as part of the city’s biennial budget.

​",https://www.wrcg.org/fredbrink
Fred Brink,2,The West Richland Mayor currently has sole discretion over hiring and salary decisions for City Staff. Should that continue or should hiring and salary decisions require concurrence with the City Council?,"The answer to this question actually rests with our city council. RCW 35A.12.090 states, “Confirmation by the city council of appointments of officers and employees shall be required only when the city charter, or the council by ordinance, provides for confirmation of such appointments.” Therefore, the current process could change immediately through a simple majority vote of the council.

It is noted also our city council already has full authority over many salary-related matters, including passing resolutions which establish personnel administrative policy, setting salary ranges for employee compensation, and implementing a pay for performance plan. The mayor is charged with executing those policies set by council. If it is perceived that city employees may be paid excessively, that is a matter for the councilmembers to address and remedy when approving employee salary schedule ranges.

Further, the city already employs a human resource manager who coordinates all hiring actions, schedules candidate interviews, and makes recommendations to the hiring manager and/or the mayor. The current process has worked well as evidenced by the very dedicated and outstanding city staff we presently possess at all levels and as reflected by council’s previous inactivity regarding the RCW cited above. However, if elected as mayor I will fully support and encourage action by council to provide their “advice and consent” on city department head-level hires.

​​",https://www.wrcg.org/fredbrink
Fred Brink,3,Should there be a succession plan for key city staff positions?,"Yes, and a succession plan for key city staff positions is already in place. Succession planning is an essential component of our city’s current administration and it will continue be a key component of my administration if elected as mayor.

Fred Brink,4,"What are your favorite aspects of West Richland and what do you think draws people to our City? Alternatively, what are your leading concerns?","Some of my favorite aspects of West Richland include our community’s family values, the plentiful parks, our extensive pathways, several great schools, the many outdoor sport and recreational opportunities as well as our wide range of housing options available in a safe, inviting, family-oriented suburban community. These are many of the key attributes which draw individuals to move to our city, including my family and I when we moved to West Richland in 2009.

Alternatively, my top concern is the lack of sufficient retail sales tax base to adequately fund park and road maintenance, police services and other critical aspects of our city operations. Cities and towns in Washington State rely on two major revenue sources for general funds – property taxes and sales tax. Our property taxes are already too high and increased sales tax revenue from business development will help to prevent potential future property tax increases.

Fortunately, our city’s Community Development Director and his team are working diligently to expand our sales tax base by actively soliciting new business. Development of the Lewis and Clark Ranch, already underway, will provide increased opportunity for businesses to locate in West Richland. Working closely with TRIDEC, our region’s economic development council, and our regional and local Chambers of Commerce, in concert with my recent election as President of the Association of Washington Cities, will provide increased visibility to businesses considering to become part of our city.

Fred Brink,5,How should current and future City Park development and maintenance be funded? Should the City establish a Parks & Recreation department or contract for private companies to provide those services? Should future neighborhood parks be maintained through HOA funding?,"There are several options to research and possibly consider in funding current and future park development and maintenance. As the question suggests, options may include establishing a Metropolitan Park District, forming HOAs to fund certain parks within local developments, establishing a city Parks & Recreation department or contracting private companies to provide those services. As such, it is premature to predetermine the best course of action to address our park concerns. However, if elected as mayor I will actively examine every alternative, in concert with our city council, our Parks Board and our citizens, as our city’s parks are a very important resource for our residents and a point of pride for our city.

Fred Brink,6,How would you improve communication between the City Council and citizens? Should more time be given for people to speak at City Council meetings? Should there be more open workshops for citizens to attend? Other suggestions?,"​

Although I frequently receive and always reply to individual emails sent to me by my constituents, city communication avenues can always be improved. Possible examples include increasing council workshops and town hall style meetings to present ideas and solicit feedback on important topics or other matters of high interest to the community. In addition, as Mayor I will plan to hold monthly “morning coffee” meetings at our city’s coffee shops, our Senior Center and other venues throughout West Richland where citizens will be able to meet with me in person to share their thoughts, offer suggestions to improve our city, or just to say “hello.”

Fred Brink,7,"What is your position on allowing adult-only businesses such as adult entertainment, casinos, etc. within City limits?","As evidenced by my city council votes on such matters since first elected in 2018, I do not support adult entertainment, casinos, retail cannabis sales or other similar adult activities in West Richland as our city is a family-oriented community. In addition to being one of the safest cities in our state, in June, 2025, West Richland was voted by a Travel and Leisure Magazine survey as the “Second Best Small Town to Live In” within the U.S.” As mayor, I intend to keep our city that way.

As I have stated in prior council meetings, and which I firmly reiterated at the July 15, 2025, council meeting, I support reviewing our current city ordinances concerning fireworks for potential changes. In addition, as one of your elected fire commissioners for Benton County Fire Protection District #4, our city’s fire and emergency medical service provider, I am working directly with the fire district to gather detailed information concerning July 4 calls for service related to fireworks in our city. I am also speaking with my fellow councilmembers and mayors pro tem in our neighboring cities to help ensure the celebration of our 4th of July holiday across the region is done in a safe and rational manner.

​​",https://www.wrcg.org/fredbrink
Fred Brink,9,What can City government do to improve transparency with the public when it comes to spending and other critical City decisions?,"West Richland is transparent with the public when it comes to spending and other critical city decisions. The city’s biennial budget, for example, is drafted several months in advance by city staff, reviewed by the mayor, and then presented to council for discussion in budget workshops which are open to the public. The proposed city budget is also presented at a minimum of two council meetings during which public comment is welcome and budget modifications are considered by council. Finally, the budget is voted on and approved by city council at an open public meeting. At all steps in this process, budget materials are also available on the city’s website for public review.

Other critical decisions the city faces are the topic of public workshops and/or open houses. Key recent examples including the construction of our city’s new police facility, the road improvements to SR224 (Van Giesen), and the planning and design associated with the development of the Lewis and Clark Ranch. In each of these major projects, and other smaller ones, the public is routinely afforded multiple opportunities to examine and comment on city plans. In addition to continuing these existing practices, as mayor I will explore other avenues to increase transparency, to expand public awareness, and to provide even greater opportunity for citizen input on critical community matters. Additionally, identifying new avenues to improve communication with our residents was one topic closely studied at the Washington State Collaborative Elected Leaders Institute, which I recently attended.

Fred Brink,10,"What can be done to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse of our City tax dollars?","​

Unfortunately, the wording of this question implies waste, fraud and abuse of city tax dollars is taking place, which is simply not true. West Richland has an outstanding Finance Department which carefully manages all city revenues and expenditures. Additionally, every city expense, to the penny, is documented, presented to, reviewed and approved by your seven elected city councilmembers during the second council meeting of each month. Further, the city’s finances are extensively examined regularly by the Office of the State Auditor for compliance with all financial rules, regulations and accepted accounting practices. These audits have been clean during my eight-year tenure on council and no evidence of any waste, fraud or abuse of city tax dollars has ever been identified.

Lastly, prior to my retirement as a Special Agent-in-Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, I oversaw many federal investigations and the subsequent prosecution of state and local government officials involved in fraud, embezzlement, public corruption and similar financial crimes. As your mayor I will ensure waste, fraud and abuse of your tax dollars never occurs in our city.

John Smart,1,"Should West Richland adopt a “City Manager” form of government, or retain the “Strong Mayor” form of government that we currently have? Please explain your rationale.","​

A qualified City Manager with experience running large projects will benefit West Richland. Our current overall annual budget is around $55M. As we grow and our City’s operation becomes more complex, a professional manager will serve our citizens well. In a City Manager and Council form of government, the Mayor serves as the “representative / face” of the city, while the City Manager organizes long term planning, keeps budgets balanced, manages staff, and deals with day-to-day operations. The City Manager would report to, and is accountable to, the City Council.

John Smart,2,The West Richland Mayor currently has sole discretion over hiring and salary decisions for City Staff. Should that continue or should hiring and salary decisions require concurrence with the City Council?,"The City would benefit from Council involvement with hiring decisions; especially concerning the selection of staff at the higher salary levels. City Council involvement should include the option to review the top10 qualified candidate resumes and listen in on candidate presentations. Council members should have the option to participate in the interview of the top 3 candidates. Ultimately, the decision to hire key positions in the City should be approved by a vote of the Council.

​​",https://www.wrcg.org/johnsmart
John Smart,3,Should there be a succession plan for key city staff positions?,"All well managed organizations maintain succession plans in depth. To the extent possible, City management must continue to develop and maintain a clear path for succession that guards against unhealthy dependency on any given staff member. Ideally, staffs currently in the organization are trained and ready to step into adjacent positions. Succession procedures can also include a pre-planned course to bring in qualified candidates from outside the organization. In any case, management must be ready to execute plans to handle critical responsibilities when staff fluctuations occur. West Richland should take advantage of the expertise that exists among the City Council to review staffing and management plans.

John Smart,4,"What are your favorite aspects of West Richland and what do you think draws people to our City? Alternatively, what are your leading concerns?","I enjoy driving home from work through a stretch of mini-farms and rural environment - without having to negotiate an overcrowded City Center. I love the quiet neighborhoods with traditional homes where kids can play with neighbors in their yards and people can walk dogs, ride bikes on trails, and go for a run in one of Washington’s safest cities! (https://www.safewise.com/blog/safest-cities-washington/)

As we grow, we face challenges that threaten our small town atmosphere. But with planning that mimics the layout of West Richland’s residential neighborhoods - separated from commercial development, I believe we can provide our children with the same rural-residential feel that we enjoy today. Commercial development is critical – but it must be pursued with vision that respects the environment West Richland Citizens cherish.

John Smart,5,How should current and future City Park development and maintenance be funded? Should the City establish a Parks & Recreation department or contract for private companies to provide those services? Should future neighborhood parks be maintained through HOA funding?,"I prefer approaches that privatize the maintenance and operations of parks and recreational opportunities.

West Richland spends about $1M annually to maintain our current parks and trails. Expert analysis indicates that we could easily spend twice that much if deferred maintenance issues were addressed. Over 90 acres of land are currently dedicated to the City’s 17 parks and 9 miles of trails. The city currently requires that new developers either pay a park impact fee or dedicate land for additional park space proportional to the size of development.

Private competitive commercial efforts will, over time, provide the most efficient means of park maintenance.

Private-Public partnerships with major local corporations or other funding entities should be explored to establish maintenance trusts for existing and new parks.

Large developments should be asked to setup funding mechanisms to maintain new park lands – whether that be through Home Owners Associations or the establishment of a sponsored foundation or trust fund.

Considering average investment returns over 40 years, a trust fund starting at $150,000 would perpetually support one acre of park land, given current maintenance and nominal projected cost increases.

Recreation programs should be organized and operated by private groups. Our citizens are free to organize and recreate as they see fit. Private organizations will always be more cost efficient and will provide service that the market demands. There is no need to be dependent on our city government to organize recreational activities.

John Smart,6,How would you improve communication between the City Council and citizens? Should more time be given for people to speak at City Council meetings? Should there be more open workshops for citizens to attend? Other suggestions?,"​

The first “button” on the City homepage is “Report a Concern” link. The City website also has a “How Do I” link that provides citizens with a menu of options – including how to contact members of the City Council and the Mayor.

Council meetings provide two opportunities for the public to comment. Each opportunity is currently restricted to three minutes. I would favor a change in the rules that provides the option for any council member to grant an extension of time, without requiring full Council consensus. Citizens should also be given the opportunity to petition council to schedule a “presentation,” which may include a slide show or other visual aids. At council’s request, citizen’s presentations would be submitted to the City Clerk for review and scheduled for a future council meeting. Citizen presentations should be limited to a reasonable period of time – perhaps 10 minutes – based on the topic and interest of the Council.

City workshops could, with the consensus of Council, include a period of public input and two-way discussion of scheduled topics. Our citizens can bring creative and valuable ideas to the table, and workshops could provide a venue where good ideas are exchanged and created in an atmosphere of appropriate decorum.

John Smart,7,"What is your position on allowing adult-only businesses such as adult entertainment, casinos, etc. within City limits?","Most Council decisions are based on strategic calculation, finance, and application of law, however, other decisions are rooted in foundational morals and ethics. Within the confines of State Law, I will work hard to keep West Richland free of adult-only businesses. Casinos, adult only stores and similar endeavors contradict the “Family Friendly” values of West Richland. I will not support the addition of recreational Marijuana sales or adult only businesses.

John Smart,8,What is your position on permitting firework sales and use within West Richland city limits? Should Municipal Code Section 8.22; “Fireworks” and Section 9.38; “Noise Regulation” be amended to be consistent?,"​

Past restrictions on fireworks in nearby cities has contributed to the concentration of 4th of July celebrations in West Richland. Our own restrictions on the use of school grounds and parks have pushed the celebrations into neighborhoods. Friends from around the area gather at West Richland homes to revel in the amazing freedoms gained by the birth of our Country.

A high level of patriotism among West Richland citizens is a hallmark of our culture. Literally thousands of households in our small community support and celebrate the 4th of July with the zeal encouraged by our founding fathers – including John Adams who, when writing about our independence day, said ""It ought to be celebrated with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward forevermore,"" and he emphasized practicing ""solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty,"" in recognition of the spiritual significance of God’s blessing on our people.

I will encourage people to continue to safely celebrate the 4th of July, which includes the use of fireworks allowed by the Washington State Law – summarized in the Washington State Patrol “Safe and Sane” publication: https://www.wsp.wa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/fireworks_stand_list_legal_and_illegal-1.pdf

I support new methods of education that would instruct people of all ages about the legal and safe use of fireworks. The possession, manufacturing, or use of illegal Explosive Devices is a criminal offense. Penalties for the illegal use of explosives – that can include fines and prison time - should be made clear through City wide communications.

Washington State Law prohibits the detonation of explosives that exceed a certain size. M-80s, M-100s, tennis ball bombs, altered fireworks, and similar devices are illegal and should be reported to authorities. There is no place in West Richland where explosives of this nature should be detonated; and those violating this law can face serious physical risk and legal consequences.

We must respect our neighbor’s property. I support efforts to enforce litter laws. In the case of aerial fireworks, people should either seek cooperation from neighbors, or abstain from activities that litter their yard or street with fireworks debris. Those who leave fireworks debris in the street or on neighbor’s property should be cited for littering.

The City could help reduce the concentration of fireworks in crowded neighborhoods by allowing organized efforts to safely use local open spaces – like designated parks or school yards. City regulations have closed the locations where fireworks can be most safely used. Given the freedom to do what makes sense, many of our neighbors would move their displays to an open green field. I would encourage civic groups and volunteers to develop an organized method to create a public display that incorporates individual fireworks and corporate contributions. This is a job for interested citizens to exercise their right to organize and carry out 4th of July celebrations. An afternoon parade that ends at Bombing Range Park, for example, where food trucks and festivities continue into the evening could draw commerce and elevate the day to the high importance it should be given. City government should not stand in the way of good practice and the reasonable use of public resources.

There is some information in the budget documents that does a good job of summarizing where our dollars come from and where they are spent. These charts and tables could be brought to the forefront of our finance page on the City website.

City staff already read the “financial impact statement” into the meeting record every time an ordinance is proposed for vote, or an action is taken.

When a proposed change or rule adoption would have a significant and widespread impact to the majority of citizens, it should be open to discussion at a Council Workshop before it is put to vote. It is important to give our taxpaying citizens a voice in the management of their City.

John Smart,10,"What can be done to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse of our City tax dollars?","​

Waste, fraud, and abuse of City funds should be reported to the office of the Mayor and our Finance Director. If appropriate, a citizen can also report issues to the Washington State Auditor – citizen hotline at 866-902-3900; or via e-mail at : https://sao.wa.gov/report-concern/how-report-concern

A balanced budget is not an indication of frugal spending. A balanced budget can include expenditures that are less than optimal; and expenditures that have not fully considered an analysis of alternatives. Like most property owners in West Richland, I do not want to see property taxes or utility rates increase beyond what is necessary to account for inflation.

Citizens can help reduce and eliminate wasted funds by electing fiscally conservative Mayor and Council members; whose character is rooted in moral absolutes. Citizens can also help by suggesting money saving strategies and operating concepts. We are a self-governed people, who need to participate in the governance of our community. Council has the authority to spend or limit spending – and input from citizens is a critical component for good decision making.

As a Council Member, I will encourage strong internal controls on spending; including one-over-one approvals for large expenditures. I will advocate for all-staff training that emphasizes the identification of waste, fraud and abuse; and instructs staff on how to report suspicions or evidence. I will continue to support our finance department to prepare and keep accurate records that are always available for inspection or audit by State officials.

Rationale for City Manager Form of Government: My foremost priority is to transition from the current Strong Mayor form of government to a City Manager (Council-Manager) structure. While the Strong Mayor system effectively serves cities with populations under 10,000 to 12,000 residents, West Richland now approaches 20,000 citizens and continues to grow. At this size, concentrating authority in one single individual is no longer conducive to sustainable development. Adopting a City Manager (Council-Manager) form of government allows City Council members to genuinely represent the citizens. This shift fosters a collaborative team environment that includes citizens, council members, and the City Manager, ensuring more effective leadership and responsiveness to the community’s needs. ​",https://www.wrcg.org/mayhays

The concentration of hiring and salary decisions in the hands of a single individual is neither equitable nor conducive to a healthy organizational environment. Such an arrangement risks the misuse of power, allowing for favoritism to override objective evaluations of employee performance. The principal concern is the absence of transparency and accountability to both the City Council and the citizens. Hiring decisions for Director positions should require the approval of City Council in order to maintain transparency and accountability.

Role of City Council in Succession and Compensation • The City Council must have a significant role in decisions regarding the hiring of senior management, approval of pay raises, benefits, and payroll. • Currently, West Richland compares salaries to larger cities such as Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland.

Nancy Aldrich,1,"Should West Richland adopt a “City Manager” form of government, or retain the “Strong Mayor” form of government that we currently have? Please explain your rationale.","​

West Richland’s population is growing and with that are the necessary infrastructure to support that growth. A City Manager form of government could provide stability and professional oversight. The Manager would serve at the whim of the council, with the council developing policy and the Manager implementing it. However, politics could interfere and the relationship could deteriorate.

Now if the residents value direct accountability, keeping the strong Mayor system may be better. The concern with this form of government in West Richland has been the lack of government experience in past mayors resulting in a huge learning curve.

I have seen five mayors while living in West Richland. I can truthfully say, in my opinion, only two were able to step in and perform the office of Mayor. They are the current mayor Brent Gerry and past mayor Jerry Peltier.

I believe with West Richland’s growing population and its growing infrastructure needs, the city will need a professional City Administrator if it stays with a Mayor-Council form of government.

Under the current “Strong Mayor” form of government, the City Council sets policy in collaboration with the Mayor, who is then responsible for carrying out those policies. His duties include the authority to hire and dismiss staff members.

Salary schedules are set within the city budget, which requires Council approval and may be adjusted during the budget process.

Nancy Aldrich,4,"What are your favorite aspects of West Richland and what do you think draws people to our City? Alternatively, what are your leading concerns?","My family moved to West Richland in 1986, when Van Giesen was just two lanes with a rickety bridge over the Yakima River, Keene Road did not exist, and Bombing Range ended at Blue Heron. My kids would ride their bikes to the Pit Stop on Van Giesen for ice cream and candy. At that time, our population was about 2,300, and today it’s over 18,000. I have seen our community grow from a small rural town into a thriving suburban city that still retains some rural character.

What draws people to live here is our family lifestyle. I watched my kids play soccer at Flat Top Park and my son play Little League at BBR Sports Complex. My husband, Steve, helped survey in the boundaries of the Sports Complex. I remember when the Boy Scouts planted trees at Bombing Range Sports Park. Those kinds of community events make West Richland special. People are drawn here for our moderate home prices, beautiful parks, local wineries, and the easy access we have to the entire Tri-Cities area.

While there is a desire by a few residents to keep West Richland rural, development continues as landowners choose to build, and with the Growth Management Act any refusal to impede growth could be complicated.

My leading concerns today are our levels of police service. We need more officers on the street and stronger training, especially for emergencies that might occur at our schools or parks. I would also like to see a Community/Senior Center and pool built to serve residents of all ages. Prosser has them. Why can’t we plan for them?

Nancy Aldrich,5,How should current and future City Park development and maintenance be funded? Should the City establish a Parks & Recreation department or contract for private companies to provide those services? Should future neighborhood parks be maintained through HOA funding?,"For funding sources for current and future development and maintenance, the city could ask the voters to approve a dedicated Parks & Recreation levy. It spreads costs across all taxpayers and ensures equitable access. They could establish a program for corporate sponsorships and naming rights (Frank Tiegs Park). It can supplement revenue and boost community-business ties. We also need to pursue more state, national and federal grants for park development.

The time has come for West Richland to establish its own Parks & Recreation Department. At one point, more West Richland children were registered for Richland’s seasonal sports programs than Richland’s own residents. This clearly shows the demand and community interest. Now we need to move forward with a plan for our own department, where consultants can design our parks, and the city provides the mowing, upkeep, and long-term maintenance.

HOA funded parks can create inequities. Neighborhoods with active HOAs may have better-maintained parks than those maintained by the City, leading to unequal access to quality recreation spaces. There is also the question of public use. Can non-HOA residents access these parks, or are they restricted? Another concern is long-term sustainability. What happens in 10 - 15 years if an HOA dissolves? Without a funding and maintenance plan in place, those parks could fall into disrepair. While I’m not a fan of HOAs, I acknowledge that in the short term, until we form our own Parks and Rec Department, they may be a necessary compromise to help meet community park needs.

I have always believed an open, two-way communication is essential for a healthy city government. Any City Council should make it easier for citizens to stay informed. I would support extending public comment time at City Council meetings when there is strong community interest in a topic. People should not feel rushed when expressing their views. More open workshops on major issues before formal votes are taken, so residents can hear background information, ask questions, and offer suggestions in a less formal setting.

These steps would help citizens feel heard, improve transparency, and ensure that Council decisions reflect the will of the community.

Nancy Aldrich,7,"What is your position on allowing adult-only businesses such as adult entertainment, casinos, etc. within City limits?","Because of my actions earlier this year, this question will become an issue for me. Earlier this year, before the March vote on retail marijuana stores, I wrote a pro statement in support of marijuana retail stores. My support was not about advocating for or against marijuana retail stores, but about supporting the voters and ensuring the voters had a voice.

I believed the “con” group might present misleading or inaccurate information in their statement, and I wanted voters to have the opportunity to decide for themselves based on facts. The city’s own survey had shown community support for marijuana, and I felt it was important it be tested at the ballot box.

I also researched how this issue would specifically affect West Richland and concluded that, if approved, any tax revenue generated should be directed toward our parks.

Whether the measure passed or failed, my priority was that the decision be made by the voters of West Richland—not by a small group without broader community input.

Now, I do not support the proliferation of adult-only businesses within West Richland city limits such as the question asked, i.e. casinos, card rooms, adult entertainment. While such establishments may generate tax revenue, they can also impact property values and increase the demand for law enforcement. If any were ever to be considered, they should be strictly regulated through zoning to ensure they are located away from schools, parks, residential areas, and other sensitive sites, with licensing requirements and operation restrictions.

Nancy Aldrich,8,What is your position on permitting firework sales and use within West Richland city limits? Should Municipal Code Section 8.22; “Fireworks” and Section 9.38; “Noise Regulation” be amended to be consistent?,"​

I’ve always enjoyed fireworks. In fact, we once had a black lab named Rufus who was convinced that “what goes up must come down.” He would watch the aerials launch and then dash around our backyard, eagerly trying to catch them as they returned to earth. He never managed to snag one, but he never stopped trying.

That said, I also recognize that times have changed. Today, we have more homes encroaching into the desert; we have more residents suffering from PTSD; and more homeowners have dogs or other pets that are distressed by fireworks. A citywide ban often sounds like a solution, but in practice it can be difficult to enforce and may not be effective.

A more balanced approach would be to amend Section 8.22 “Fireworks” to specifically prohibit the sale and use of aerial fireworks within West Richland city limits. These present the greatest safety hazards, noise concerns, and risk of property damage or wildfire. Limiting permitted fireworks to ground-based, non-aerial types would still allow residents to celebrate Independence Day in a festive manner while reducing noise complaints, injuries, and fire incidents.

Additionally, the permitted use period should be restricted to July 4th, from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM, to reduce disruptions to residents, pets, and veterans sensitive to loud noises. This provides clarity for both residents and law enforcement, helping to ensure compliance and minimize neighborhood disputes.

To ensure consistency, Section 9.38 “Noise Regulation” should be reviewed and amended in conjunction with the fireworks code so that both ordinances clearly align on allowable times and types of noise-producing activities.

The State Auditor conducts a comprehensive review of the City every three years, auditing all departments, budgets, dedicated funds, and personnel policies. In my past experience, as a former West Richland council member and Benton Clean Air Agency Board, any financial fraud is detected quickly. West Richland has received several state awards for its budget practices, which speaks to our strong fiscal management. While there is no evidence of fraud, I believe there is always room to reduce waste and improve efficiency. This can be achieved by regularly reviewing expenditures, setting clear performance metrics, and ensuring that projects and services deliver measurable value to taxpayers.

Both “Strong Mayor” and “City Manager” forms of government have potential issues but I believe the “Strong Mayor” form is the better form of government. Based on the experience of the other local municipalities I believe the “City Manager” approach is not the best option for the City of West Richland at this time. While the “Strong Mayor” form of government can result in having inconsistent or ineffective leadership; however, the same can be said of “City Manager”.

Turnover of City managers can be very disruptive to the city, and replacement can be time consuming. Good city managers are difficult to find and are expensive.
