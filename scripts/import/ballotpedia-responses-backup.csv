Austin Miller,Kennewick City Council Ward 1,Kennewick,1,Who are you? Tell us about yourself.,"My name is Austin Miller. I am a teacher and a researcher. I have spent over ten years behind the scenes as a policy analyst for local, state, and federal agencies, and I’m excited to bring my experience to the job of serving the people of Kennewick. I take time to carefully think through problems and work hard to consider all sides of an issue by communicating with clarity and respect. I am also a husband and a father. I’m thankful for the support of my partner and my children who are excited about me running for city council. Without their willingness to share a bit of me with you, I would not be able to do this. I grew up here in Kennewick. Many things are still the same as when I was a kid, but a lot has changed. We need to work together to understand these changes and adapt to make sure the best opportunities are available to as many people in our community as possible. This means being intentional about how we grow and coming up with creative and flexible solutions when necessary. My main goal is to prioritize kindness and inclusion in city policies. This is my first time running for public office, and I hope to inspire more people to get involved in serving our community. I want people to know that their voice is the strongest when they speak about local issues. It is easy to get discouraged when we focus on things that we can’t control, but I believe there are many hopeful opportunities to make life better when we work together at the local level.","https://ballotpedia.org/Austin_Miller_(Kennewick_City_Council_Ward_1_Position_1,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Austin Miller,Kennewick City Council Ward 1,Kennewick,2,Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?,"My first key message is community support and inclusion. Community is more than just the people who live nearby; it’s a feeling of security that comes from knowing that these people have your back. This is what I want most for the place that my kids get to grow up. National news makes it seem like we have a lot to fight over, but I believe we have more in common than we have disagreements. We can build community by investing in organizations that provide services to those who need them, and in those that bring people together. And if any people who live in Kennewick are threatened by policies and events outside of our control, then I also think it’s important that they know that our city supports them and we will stand up for them.The economy doesn’t work the way that it used to. More and more people in our community are having to work multiple jobs to afford housing or healthcare. People are often starting businesses out of necessity, rather than passion or inspiration. I think that understanding this puts us in a better place to support our friends and neighbors in Kennewick. We should invest in organizations that offer business training, shared workspaces, and tools for people starting out. We should also encourage local entrepreneurs to work together and learn from one another. If one person succeeds at opening a salon, or a new food truck, or a business selling homemade jewelry online, then we all win.I am excited to see Kennewick embracing more mixed-use development. These are neighborhoods where people can walk to get groceries, a haircut, or other locally available goods and services. I think we should continue this trend by allowing more small commercial zoning spaces in and near our residential spaces. This should include new developments, but we can also find ways to reuse buildings and land in older neighborhoods. This kind of development offers more opportunities for small businesses because they no longer have to fight for space in the same busy shopping zones. It also helps ease traffic on major roads and supports stronger, more connected communities.","https://ballotpedia.org/Austin_Miller_(Kennewick_City_Council_Ward_1_Position_1,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Austin Miller,Kennewick City Council Ward 1,Kennewick,3,What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?,I am passionate about making our community a safe place where our kids can thrive. I am passionate about ensuring economic stability for as many people as possible. I am passionate about making sure that the opportunities we want for ourselves and our children are available to every resident of Kennewick. All people deserve to be treated with kindness and respect and to be included in all the benefits of our city.,"https://ballotpedia.org/Austin_Miller_(Kennewick_City_Council_Ward_1_Position_1,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Austin Miller,Kennewick City Council Ward 1,Kennewick,4,What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?,"The city council is responsible for the policies and the budget of the city. It is their job to make sure that public resources are used efficiently and in a way that is considerate of the needs of everyone in the community. I also believe it is the job of the city council to inspire the people that we serve, and to be a champion of our shared values. It is easy for a person to get involved when they have something to gain personally or financially, but the city council should serve all the people in a city. We should cultivate the desire that people naturally have to help and support each other.","https://ballotpedia.org/Austin_Miller_(Kennewick_City_Council_Ward_1_Position_1,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Austin Miller,Kennewick City Council Ward 1,Kennewick,5,What legacy would you like to leave?,I am not interested in any personal legacy. I don't care if anyone remembers my name.

I just want as many people as possible to have the types of opportunities I have had and to feel the sense of community that has made my life meaningful and full. I want my children to be happy and successful. And I want the same for you and yours.,"https://ballotpedia.org/Austin_Miller_(Kennewick_City_Council_Ward_1_Position_1,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"

Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,1,Who are you? Tell us about yourself.,"I am proud to serve as the current president of the Pasco School Board, where I have been a director for the past three years. Alongside my board service, I have been an educator in our region for ten years, teaching in both dual-language and middle school settings. I hold a bachelor’s and master’s degree in education, as well as a principal certificate, which gives me a unique perspective on how decisions made in the boardroom impact classrooms every day. As a teacher, I see firsthand the challenges our students face and the incredible difference that resources, support, and high expectations make in their success. As a board member, I bring that experience into my leadership, working to ensure that our policies are focused on student achievement and equity. My commitment is to listen, collaborate, and keep students at the heart of every decision.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,2,Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?,"Over the past three years, I have kept partisan politics out of the school board. Our boardroom should be focused on students, families, and the success of our schools—not political agendas. I have never campaigned on a party label, because education should serve the whole community. My opponent is running on party politics, including diverting public funds to private schools, which would hurt Pasco students. What sets me apart is that I listen to all voices and keep students at the center of every decision. Pasco voters trusted me with that responsibility three years ago, and I remain committed to being a balanced voice for our community.Like many districts across Washington, Pasco faces financial challenges because the state does not fully fund education. To protect the programs and resources our students rely on, we must pass the local levy—it not only provides direct funding but also secures matching dollars from the state. At the same time, the board has adopted a responsible four-year plan to rebuild reserves to 5% through employee attrition, not layoffs. This means as staff naturally retire or move on, we can reduce costs without cutting services or disrupting classrooms. My focus is to be transparent, protect quality education, and make sure we balance our budget without harming students or staff.As both a teacher and board president, I know how critical it is to keep student learning at the center of our work. That’s why the board revised the superintendent’s evaluation to tie it directly to student outcomes. For the first time, the superintendent is held accountable for measurable improvements in student growth and achievement. This year, we directed the district to strengthen how students in need of academic support are identified and served, and to improve early interventions for students at risk of not graduating. My commitment is simple: every student should have the tools, opportunities, and support to succeed—and I will continue to make that my priority.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,3,What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?,"I am most passionate about education policies that put student achievement at the center. For me, that means maintaining a balanced budget without cutting the programs and resources students depend on. I believe we must protect and strengthen services that directly impact classrooms, even during challenging financial times. I am also deeply committed to policies that support multilingual learners, who make up 37% of Pasco’s students. Expanding and sustaining dual language programs gives students the opportunity to thrive academically while also preparing them for success in a bilingual world. My focus is on practical, student-centered policies that ensure every child has the tools and support they need to succeed.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,4,What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?,"For me, the most important characteristics of an elected official are balance, integrity, and a commitment to listening. As board president, I have worked hard to ensure our focus remains on student achievement and district priorities, not partisan politics. I believe elected officials should lead with transparency and collaboration, creating space for all voices to be heard, not just those who agree with us. As a classroom teacher with ten years of experience, I bring a unique perspective to this role. In the classroom, I’ve learned that leadership is about listening, meeting people where they are, and helping them grow. Empathy, patience, and consistency are essential qualities for a teacher, and I believe they are just as important for an elected official. When students struggle, I work with them to find solutions and give them the tools they need to succeed. On the board, I take that same approach—asking questions, weighing options, and seeking solutions that benefit all students. Equally important is the principle of accountability. Three years ago, Pasco voters placed their trust in me to represent our community with fairness and to keep students at the center of every decision. I have honored that trust by ensuring our decisions are grounded in student outcomes and by working to protect the programs and services our families rely on. In my view, elected officials must always remember that leadership is service. Our responsibility is to steward public resources wisely, protect opportunities for students, and act with the long-term health of the community in mind. Whether in the classroom or in the boardroom, my guiding principle has been the same: listen first, act with integrity, and never lose sight of the fact that every decision we make has a direct impact on the lives of students and families in our community.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,5,What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?,"The core responsibilities of a school board member are to keep students at the center of every decision, to ensure fiscal responsibility with taxpayer dollars, and to set clear policy direction for the district. Our role is not to micromanage schools, but to provide the vision, accountability, and oversight that help students succeed. As both a teacher and board president, I see this responsibility from two perspectives. In the classroom, I know that decisions made at the board level affect real students every day. On the board, I work to make sure those decisions are grounded in what will best support student learning, equity, and opportunity. That means approving policies and budgets that protect classrooms and programs, monitoring student outcomes, and holding the superintendent accountable to clear, measurable goals. Another core responsibility is to serve as a bridge between the community and the district. A good board member listens to parents, staff, and students, and weighs those perspectives carefully while making decisions that benefit all students—not just a select group. Transparency, collaboration, and trust are essential. Ultimately, the responsibility of this office is to provide steady, student-focused leadership. For me, that means protecting programs like dual language that are vital to our 37% multilingual learners, maintaining a balanced budget without cutting core services, and keeping the focus on student achievement above all else.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,6,What is something that has been a struggle in your life?,"One of the biggest struggles in my life has been raising my children as a single mom while also working to complete my education. Balancing family responsibilities, work, and school was not easy. There were many times when it felt overwhelming, but I knew that earning my bachelor’s degree would change the trajectory of my life and my children’s lives. That accomplishment gave me new opportunities and showed my kids the power of perseverance and education. This struggle also gave me a deep belief in education as a transformational tool. I have experienced firsthand how education can break down barriers and open doors. That’s why, as both a teacher and a school board member, I am passionate about helping students and families see that same possibility for their futures. My journey motivates me to ensure Pasco schools provide the resources, programs, and support students need to succeed—no matter their background or circumstances. This belief has guided my work on the board for the past three years, and it is why I am running for re-election: to keep fighting for every student to have the chance to thrive.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,7,What is the primary job of a school board member in your view?,"In my view, the primary job of a school board member is to ensure that every decision we make supports student success. That means setting a clear vision for the district, adopting policies that strengthen teaching and learning, and holding the superintendent accountable for results. Board members are not there to run schools day-to-day, but to provide oversight and direction that keeps students at the center of everything we do. As a teacher with ten years of experience and as the current board president, I know firsthand how decisions made in the boardroom affect real classrooms. That’s why I believe a school board member must also listen carefully to parents, staff, and students, and weigh those perspectives before making decisions that serve the entire community—not just a narrow group. Transparency, collaboration, and accountability are core to the job. This is where I differ from my opponent. Three years ago, Pasco voters chose my leadership because I promised to keep partisan politics out of the boardroom. I have honored that promise. I do not campaign on a party label because our schools belong to the whole community. My opponent, however, is running again on party politics and supports ideas such as diverting public tax dollars to private schools. At a time when Pasco is already facing potential federal funding cuts, those policies would harm our students and weaken our district. The primary job of a school board member is not to advance a political agenda, but to serve students. For me, that means protecting programs like dual language that are vital to our 37% multilingual learners, maintaining a balanced budget without cutting core services, and keeping student achievement at the forefront of every decision. That is the kind of steady, student-centered leadership I have worked to provide—and will continue to provide if re-elected.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,8,Who are your constituents?,"For me, students are my first and most important constituents. Every decision I make as a school board member begins with the question: how will this impact student learning and success? My focus is on ensuring that every child in Pasco has the tools, resources, and opportunities they need to thrive academically and personally. Student achievement is, and must remain, our north star. The next group of stakeholders are parents. I firmly believe that strong parent partnerships with schools are essential for student success. When parents feel welcomed, respected, and included, students benefit. As both a teacher and board president, I’ve seen firsthand the difference family engagement makes in student learning, and I am committed to continuing to strengthen those connections across our district. Staff are another critical priority. Pasco must be able to attract and retain qualified teachers, paraeducators, and support staff in every department. Students succeed when they have stable, highly skilled adults supporting them. That requires us to maintain competitive compensation, provide meaningful professional development, and ensure that staff feel valued and supported in their work. Finally, community partnerships play a vital role in our district’s success. Pasco has built strong ties through programs like PEAK Partners, which connect local businesses with schools; Partners in Kindness, which organizes donations and volunteer efforts; and HOPE partnerships with faith-based organizations that help meet student needs beyond academics. These partnerships strengthen our schools and reflect the commitment of our entire community to the success of our students. Together—students, parents, staff, and community—we all share the responsibility for student achievement. As a board member, my role is to listen, connect these groups, and ensure that the policies and resources we adopt create the strongest possible foundation for Pasco’s students.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,9,"How would you support the diverse needs of your district’s students, faculty, staff, and community?","Supporting the diverse needs of our students, staff, and community begins with the belief that every child deserves the opportunity to succeed. For me, that starts with student achievement as the guiding focus of the board. Students are my first constituents, and every decision I make is measured by how it impacts their learning and long-term success. I bring seven years of experience as a dual language teacher, and I know firsthand the power of bilingual programs to transform lives. In Pasco, 37% of our students are multilingual learners, and expanding and sustaining dual language education not only supports them, but benefits all students by preparing them to thrive in a bilingual world. This is an area where my classroom background allows me to bring both expertise and passion to my role as a board member. Equally important is supporting parents. Strong parent-school partnerships are essential for student success, and I am committed to ensuring our schools welcome, respect, and engage families as vital partners in education. Our staff are also central to meeting diverse needs. We must continue to attract and retain high-quality teachers, paraeducators, and support staff by valuing their work, providing professional growth, and creating conditions that allow them to stay in Pasco and make a difference for students. Finally, our community plays a key role. Programs like PEAK Partners, Partners in Kindness, and HOPE partnerships connect businesses, nonprofits, and faith organizations directly to our schools, expanding opportunities for students and addressing needs beyond the classroom. Supporting diversity means more than acknowledging differences—it means providing resources, accountability, and collaboration so that all students, families, and staff feel seen, supported, and empowered to succeed. That is the perspective I bring as both a teacher and as board president, and it is the commitment I will continue to carry forward.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,10,"How will you build relationships with members of the broader community? Which groups, organizations, stakeholders will you specifically target?","Being present and engaged in the community is one of the most important responsibilities of a school board member. I believe leadership is about showing up—not just in the boardroom, but alongside families, staff, and students at the events that make Pasco strong. I regularly attend Action Team Partnership (ATP) events, which connect families and schools in meaningful ways. Strong parent-school partnerships are essential to student success, and being part of these events allows me to listen directly to parents and strengthen that connection. I also believe in connecting the district with the broader city of Pasco. Our participation in community events such as the Fourth of July parade and the Fiery Foods Festival shows that our schools are a proud and visible part of this community. Equally important is being present at school-sponsored events. Attending sports, concerts, and performing arts programs allows me to celebrate student achievements beyond the classroom and to support the staff who help students shine in these areas. As both a teacher and board president, I know that strong schools are built on strong relationships. By showing up, listening, and engaging at every level—whether with parents, community partners, or at student events—I work to ensure that the Pasco School District remains connected to the people it serves.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,11,What constitutes good teaching? How will you measure this? How will you support advanced teaching approaches?,"Good teaching begins with a focus on students—building relationships, setting high expectations, and creating classrooms where every child feels a sense of belonging and hope for the future. Research shows that belonging is directly tied to achievement. In Pasco, where 37% of our students are multilingual learners, good teaching also means ensuring equitable access to dual language programs and strategies that support diverse learners. As a teacher for ten years, I know what effective teaching looks like. I was a GLAD model classroom teacher, trained to demonstrate strategies that improve language development and engagement. I have also worked collaboratively with colleagues to design lessons, analyze data, and raise achievement. My principal certificate training prepared me to recognize proficient and distinguished levels of teaching through formal evaluation systems, giving me a clear lens for measuring quality instruction. Good teaching is measured through classroom practice, student growth data, and the feedback of students and families. To support advanced approaches, I believe in giving teachers strong professional development and time to collaborate. Research shows that collective teacher efficacy—the shared belief that educators can positively impact students—has the greatest effect on achievement. That is why I will continue to encourage Pasco to expand its Professional Learning Community (PLC) work, where teachers collaborate and use data to guide instruction. Ultimately, good teaching is measured by its impact on students. As both a teacher and board president, I will continue to support policies that value teacher expertise, foster collaboration, and ensure every student has access to excellent instruction.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,12,What strategies or plans would you advance to ensure the schools are properly funded?,"Ensuring schools are properly funded is one of the most important responsibilities of the board, and it requires both advocacy and careful stewardship. Like many districts across Washington, Pasco faces a funding gap because the state does not fully fund education. One of the most important strategies to protect our schools is passing the local levy. The levy not only funds critical programs and services but also unlocks millions of matching dollars from the state that we lose if it fails. At the same time, we must be responsible with the funds we already have. The board has adopted a four-year plan to rebuild reserves to 5% through employee attrition—reductions that occur naturally through retirements or resignations—rather than through layoffs. This approach protects classrooms and avoids disrupting the programs and services students rely on. Cutting staff in large numbers would harm morale and weaken student achievement, which I will not support. Beyond local action, I also believe the board must continue advocating at the state level for a more equitable and sustainable funding model. Pasco is not alone in facing financial strain, and we must make sure lawmakers hear directly from us how these challenges affect students. As both a teacher and board president, my focus is to ensure that every dollar is used to support student learning. That means protecting programs like dual language, maintaining essential services, and ensuring that funding decisions are always tied to student outcomes. With transparent budgeting, responsible planning, and strong community partnerships, we can maintain quality education while working toward the long-term financial health of the district.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,13,What principles drive your policies for safety in schools?,"Levy funding is absolutely essential to maintaining the programs and services that keep Pasco schools strong—and safe. Many people don’t realize that some of our most important supports are funded directly by levy dollars. For example, while our School Resource Officers are funded through partnerships, the additional security staff who monitor cameras, help enforce behavior expectations, and lead proactive measures to increase student safety are funded by the local levy. Without these dollars, we would lose key layers of protection that create safe learning environments for students. The levy also funds other critical programs that directly impact student success, from academic interventions to extracurricular opportunities. In fact, if the levy were to fail, Pasco would not only lose local funding, but the state would also withhold millions of matching dollars, leaving our students without resources they depend on. That is why I am committed to both passing the levy and maintaining transparency about how those dollars are spent. The community deserves to know that their investment goes directly toward student achievement and safety. At the same time, the board has taken responsible steps to rebuild reserves to 5% through employee attrition rather than layoffs, protecting the classrooms and services students need. As both a teacher and board president, I know that families expect us to keep students safe while providing the best possible education. Levy dollars allow us to do both—funding security measures that protect our schools while also supporting the academic programs that prepare students for the future. Ensuring continued levy support is one of the most important strategies we have to keep Pasco schools strong.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,14,How might you support the mental health needs of students/faculty/staff?,"I believe every student deserves to feel that they belong in their school and that they have hope for the future. Belonging is one of Pasco School District’s “outrageous outcomes,” and I have championed this work because research shows belonging is directly tied to student achievement. When students feel safe, valued, and connected, they are more engaged in learning and more likely to thrive. As a board member, I have supported policies and initiatives that make belonging more than just words on paper. One example is our decision to place mental health clinics in schools to better serve students. We know that students cannot fully focus on academics if their emotional and mental health needs are not being met. These clinics provide accessible, immediate support to students, reduce barriers for families, and show that schools care about the whole child. In my WSSDA Board of Distinction application, I highlighted Pasco’s commitment to student mental health as one of our district’s most important accomplishments. By investing in mental health supports, building systems of early identification and intervention, and focusing on belonging, we are creating schools where students feel connected and supported not only academically, but also socially and emotionally. As both a teacher and board president, I see how much of a difference this work makes. Students who feel they belong are more willing to take risks in learning. Students who can access mental health support are better able to succeed in class. And families who know their children are cared for develop stronger trust in our schools. Supporting student well-being through belonging and mental health is not separate from academic work—it is the foundation of it. This belief has guided my leadership, and it will continue to be a central focus of my work on the board.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,15,"What existing district policies would you like to change, or what new policies would you like to implement?","At this time, I do not believe our district needs sweeping new policies, but rather a continued focus on strengthening the policies we already have in place. Over the past three years, I have worked to ensure that our policies are centered on student achievement, fiscal responsibility, and belonging. One example is the board’s revision of the superintendent evaluation process to tie it directly to student outcomes, which creates greater accountability and transparency. Looking ahead, I believe we can continue to strengthen policies that support student well-being and belonging. For instance, I supported the establishment of school-based mental health clinics, and I would like to see our policies expand access to mental health supports for both students and staff. I also believe we should refine our family engagement policies so that every parent feels welcomed, respected, and informed, no matter their language or background. Finally, I will continue to prioritize policies that sustain and expand our dual language programs, which serve 37% of our multilingual learners and benefit all students by preparing them for a bilingual world. This is where I differ from my opponent. While I have focused on policies that strengthen student achievement, protect essential programs, and create equitable opportunities, he is running on a platform centered on party politics and proposals to divert public dollars to private schools. At a time when Pasco faces budget challenges and possible federal funding cuts, that approach would hurt students and weaken our schools. My commitment is to keep policies grounded in what matters most—supporting students, families, and staff so every child has the chance to succeed.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"

Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,17,Describe your ideal learning environment for students.,"My ideal learning environment begins with belonging. One of Pasco School District’s five outrageous outcomes is that students will feel a sense of belonging in their schools and hope for the future. I have championed this outcome because research shows belonging directly impacts student achievement. When students feel safe, valued, and connected, they are more engaged and more successful. Belonging means every student knows they matter. That includes classrooms that reflect diversity, provide support for individual needs, and strengthen our dual language programs for the 37% of students who are multilingual learners. As a dual language teacher for seven years, I saw how bilingual education empowers students and builds stronger communities. Belonging also grows when families are welcomed as partners. That’s why I supported ParentSquare, which translates into 50+ languages, and why I attend Action Team Partnership events and community celebrations to listen and connect with families. Students thrive when staff feel valued too. Pasco’s leadership development programs and competitive pay help us attract and retain excellent educators, which is critical for student success. Finally, community partnerships—like PEAK Partners, Partners in Kindness, and HOPE—extend belonging beyond the classroom, linking students with businesses, organizations, and faith groups that support them. My vision of an ideal learning environment is one where belonging is at the center, families and staff are supported, and the community works together so every child has hope for the future.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,18,What will you do to build a relationship with parents in the district?,"uilding strong relationships with parents begins with open, consistent communication. One of the steps the board has taken to strengthen that connection is approving ParentSquare, an online communication tool that allows parents and staff to easily connect. What makes ParentSquare especially powerful is that it translates messages into more than 50 languages, ensuring that every family—no matter their home language—has access to information about their child’s education. In a diverse district like Pasco, where 37% of our students are multilingual learners, this kind of tool is critical. As a teacher, I know firsthand how important communication with families is to student achievement. When parents are informed, welcomed, and engaged, students do better in school. I have seen the difference it makes when families feel connected to their child’s classroom, and I bring that perspective into my work on the board. But tools alone are not enough. Building real relationships requires presence, listening, and collaboration. That’s why I make it a priority to attend Action Team Partnership (ATP) events, where families and schools come together to plan and problem-solve. I also connect with parents at school events, sports, concerts, and community gatherings like the Fourth of July parade and the Fiery Foods Festival. These moments are more than celebrations—they are opportunities to listen and to strengthen trust. Ultimately, parents are vital partners in student success. As both a teacher and board president, I will continue to champion policies and programs that make communication easier, create more opportunities for engagement, and ensure that every parent feels their voice is heard and valued in Pasco schools.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,19,"What are your preferred strategies for faculty, staff, and administration recruitment?","Recruiting and retaining high-quality faculty, staff, and administrators begins with building a strong bench from within. Pasco has developed the strongest leadership development program in the region, and I believe it is one of our greatest assets. By investing in our own employees, we create pathways for teachers, paraeducators, and staff to grow into leadership roles. This not only provides stability for our schools but also ensures that those stepping into new positions already understand our students, families, and community. Competitive compensation is another important strategy. Pasco offers competitive pay, which helps us attract talent in a very competitive market. But recruitment is about more than paychecks—it’s also about creating a culture where staff feel valued, supported, and equipped to do their best work. That includes meaningful professional development, strong mentorship opportunities, and ensuring that staff have the resources they need to be successful in their roles. As both a teacher and a board president, I know that students succeed when they are supported by highly skilled, committed adults who feel invested in the district. That is why I am committed to policies that not only bring talented educators and leaders to Pasco, but also keep them here by showing them that their work matters and their contributions are valued. In short, our best strategy for recruitment is also a strategy for retention: grow leaders from within, provide competitive pay, and foster a district culture that supports and celebrates the people who dedicate themselves to serving students. By continuing to build our leadership pipeline and investing in our staff, we strengthen both our workforce and the future of Pasco’s students.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,20,Are there any areas of school curriculum you would like to see changed?,"At this time, I do not believe there are areas of our school curriculum that need to be changed. Pasco already has a strong and transparent process in place to ensure that the instructional materials we use are high quality, research-based, and aligned with the needs of our students. Curriculum adoption begins with a team of teachers who research and pilot materials. Their expertise allows them to evaluate what works best in classrooms. Once narrowed to one option, the curriculum is opened to parents and the community for review and feedback. From there, it goes to the Instructional Materials Committee—a diverse team of parents, staff, students, and community members—for a thorough review. Finally, the recommendation is brought before the school board for approval in a public meeting. This process ensures multiple perspectives are included, maintains transparency, and places student learning at the center. As both a teacher and board president, I believe this process is sufficient to identify quality instructional materials and reflect the values of our community. This is a clear difference between me and my opponent. I trust in a collaborative process where teachers, families, and community members have a voice in curriculum decisions. My opponent is running a campaign rooted in partisan politics, which risks injecting political agendas into the classroom. I believe our students deserve better—decisions about what and how they learn should remain in the hands of educators and the community, not political interests.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Amanda Brown,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,21,What role should artificial intelligence have in your school district?,"AI is a tool that is becoming more common in education, and like any tool, it needs to be used responsibly. I do not believe AI should ever be used by students to do their work for them. Learning is about developing critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills, and those cannot be replaced by technology. However, AI can be a valuable resource when used correctly. For students, it can support research, provide additional explanations, and help them practice skills in new ways. It should be a supplement to learning, not a shortcut. For teachers and staff, AI has the potential to reduce workload and free up more time to focus on students. It can support lesson planning, streamline communication, and help analyze student data to better identify where interventions are needed. Used wisely, it can enhance teaching and support staff in their critical work. As both a teacher and board president, my focus is to ensure AI is used ethically and responsibly in our schools—leveraging it to expand opportunities for students and staff while still keeping the heart of education rooted in human connection, creativity, and problem-solving.","https://ballotpedia.org/Amanda_Brown_(Pasco_School_District_school_board_District_3,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"

Braden Sloughter,West Richland City Council Position 4,West Richland,1,Who are you? Tell us about yourself.,"I’ve called West Richland home long enough to remember when the bridge into town was just two lanes, the library had its patchwork carpet, and you could shop at Mel’s. As a kid, I even spent afternoons playing with kittens at the old hardware store. Over the years I’ve watched our city grow with new schools, new neighborhoods, and even a grocery store again, yet through it all, West Richland has held onto the small-town character that makes it special. My family has lived here since the 1970s, and my dad briefly served on City Council when I was young. With 30+ years here myself, I bring both a long history in our community and a clear vision for its future. Professionally, I work as an IT Engineer at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. My path has been diverse, from cake decorator and barista to marketing and design professional to railcar accountant. I’ve worked for small local businesses, government, and large corporations, giving me a broad understanding of how organizations run and how decisions affect people’s daily lives. I’ve also served our community on the West Richland Parks & Recreation Board, Planning Commission, Richland Parks & Recreation Commission, and the Mid-Columbia Symphony Board. These roles have given me firsthand experience in how local policy shapes neighborhoods, recreation, and quality of life. I’m running for City Council to protect what makes West Richland home while planning smart for the growth ahead.","https://ballotpedia.org/Braden_Sloughter_(West Richland_City_Council_Position_4,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Braden Sloughter,West Richland City Council Position 4,West Richland,2,Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?,"Smart Growth, Small-Town Character West Richland is growing, and pretending it isn’t is how communities end up with poor planning and traffic headaches. I’ve lived here for 30+ years, and I believe we can welcome growth while protecting the small-town character that makes this home. By planning smart, investing in infrastructure, and protecting our parks and open spaces, we can ensure West Richland grows stronger without losing what makes it special.Fireworks & Community Safety I love celebrating the 4th of July and enjoying a fireworks show, but this year proved how dangerous things can get in the wrong conditions. A total ban sounds simple enforcement doesn't seem realistic. I support limiting the days and hours fireworks can be used, cracking down on reckless behavior, changing what fireworks are legal, and aligning our fireworks and noise codes so they’re clear and enforceable. Let’s keep the fun while protecting our neighborhoods.Fiscal Responsibility & Transparency City government needs to do more with what we have, not ask for more. I’ll fight to keep taxes low while ensuring public safety, infrastructure, and parks are prioritized. That means audits, competitive bidding, and expanding our tax base through smart development. I also believe residents deserve transparency: easy-to-understand updates, open workshops, and clear processes so everyone has a voice in shaping our future.","https://ballotpedia.org/Braden_Sloughter_(West Richland_City_Council_Position_4,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Braden Sloughter,West Richland City Council Position 4,West Richland,3,What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?,"I’m passionate about smart growth, community safety, and transparency in local government. West Richland is growing quickly, and if we don’t plan carefully, we risk losing the small-town character that makes this place special. I want to make sure development comes with the infrastructure, parks, and open spaces we need to keep quality of life high. Community safety is also critical, from supporting our police and firefighters to addressing real concerns like fireworks and wildfire risks. Finally, I believe government works best when residents are informed and involved. I’m passionate about improving communication, making city processes easier to understand, and ensuring people have a voice in the decisions that shape their neighborhoods.","https://ballotpedia.org/Braden_Sloughter_(West Richland_City_Council_Position_4,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Braden Sloughter,West Richland City Council Position 4,West Richland,4,What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?,"Integrity, common sense, and accountability are the qualities I value most in public service. Elected officials should listen first, make decisions based on facts and community values, and be willing to explain those decisions clearly. It’s important to approach issues with transparency and honesty, even when the answers aren’t easy. I also believe an effective leader has to balance long-term planning with practical solutions that work today — thinking ahead while protecting what makes our community strong right now. Most importantly, an elected official should remember they serve their neighbors, not a political party or personal agenda.","https://ballotpedia.org/Braden_Sloughter_(West Richland_City_Council_Position_4,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"

Fred Brink,West Richland Mayor,West Richland,1,Who are you? Tell us about yourself.,"I am a U.S. Navy veteran and a retired Special-Agent-in-Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. My family and I moved to West Richland, WA, in 2009 after my retirement from the FBI, where I began work as a national security program manager at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory until retirement in 2019. My wife and I have two adult sons who both serve on active duty - one with the U.S. Army and the other with the U.S. Navy.","https://ballotpedia.org/Fred_Brink_(Mayor_of_West_Richland,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Fred Brink,West Richland Mayor,West Richland,2,Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?,"West Richland will continue to experience rapid population growth in the years ahead and my leadership as mayor in our city’s planning and future development will help balance residential, commercial, and recreational needs while addressing infrastructure and public safety requirements. I possess the qualities essential for an effective mayor (or any other city leader), which include collaboration, mutual respect, influence, courage, combined with the ability to solve complex problems and deliver practical solutions that will benefit the City of West Richland.It is argued West Richland needs to change its current form of government because the city has grown too large for one person to effectively manage. In fact, our present form of city government, the Mayor-Council structure, is the most common form of government in Washington with 228 cities, or MORE THAN 81 PERCENT OF ALL WASHINTON CITIES, using this model. Further the size of the city is irrelevant as even many of our state's largest cities are Mayor-Council communities. As a city manager will cost us more than $200,000 each year, the money needed for this position doesn't exist in our city budget without dramatic cuts in other areas. In summary, this impractical idea has not been vetted or thoroughly considered to any extent.My life is one of public service, and giving back to our community is why I first volunteered to serve on the West Richland Planning Commission and later run for City Council. Presently, I also serve on the governor's Forensic Advisory Council, our state's Emergency Management Council, and the Benton County Law and Justice Council. Several years ago, my fellow councilmembers unanimously chose me as our city's Mayor pro tem and, in addition, my peers across Washington State elected me as President of the Association of Washington Cities (AWC) in June. I am committed to the thoughtful and pragmatic stewardship of our great community.","https://ballotpedia.org/Fred_Brink_(Mayor_of_West_Richland,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"

Fred Brink,West Richland Mayor,West Richland,4,What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?,"It is extremely important for any mayor (as the city's chief executive officer) to possess the background, education, ability and experience to effectively manage city staff and ensure the services every citizen expects and needs are delivered every day.","https://ballotpedia.org/Fred_Brink_(Mayor_of_West_Richland,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Fred Brink,West Richland Mayor,West Richland,5,What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?,"One of the first major historical events i remember is Neil Armstrong’s walk on the moon on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission. This event was an extraordinary milestone in human history and space exploration. Alongside Buzz Aldrin, Armstrong walked on the lunar surface and Michael Collins orbited above, while millions worldwide watched in awe - including me! This monumental event captured the achievement not only of landing on another celestial body but also of American ingenuity, teamwork and determination. The moon landing inspired me as it symbolized the potential of scientific and technological progress. For me, it remains a lasting memory and a testament to humanity’s need and desire to explore the unknown.","https://ballotpedia.org/Fred_Brink_(Mayor_of_West_Richland,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Fred Brink,West Richland Mayor,West Richland,6,What do you love most about your city?,"Some of my favorite aspects of West Richland include our community’s family focus, the plentiful parks, our extensive pathways, several great schools, the many outdoor sport and recreational opportunities as well as our wide range of housing options available in a safe, inviting, family-oriented suburban community. These are many of the key attributes which draw individuals to move to our city, including my family and I when we moved to West Richland in 2009.","https://ballotpedia.org/Fred_Brink_(Mayor_of_West_Richland,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
Fred Brink,West Richland Mayor,West Richland,7,What do you perceive to be your city's greatest challenges over the next decade?,"My top concern is the lack of sufficient retail sales tax base to adequately fund park and road maintenance, police services and other critical aspects of our city operations. Cities and towns in Washington State rely on two major revenue sources for general funds – property taxes and sales tax. Our property taxes are already too high and increased sales tax revenue from business development will help to prevent potential future property tax increases. Fortunately, our city’s Community Development Director and his team are working diligently to expand our sales tax base by actively soliciting new business. Development of the Lewis and Clark Ranch, already underway, will provide increased opportunity for businesses to locate in West Richland. Working closely with TRIDEC, our region’s economic development council, and our regional and local Chambers of Commerce, in concert with my recent election as President of the Association of Washington Cities, will provide increased visibility to businesses considering becoming part of our city.","https://ballotpedia.org/Fred_Brink_(Mayor_of_West_Richland,_Washington,_candidate_2025)"
