Fred Brink,West Richland Mayor,West Richland,0,How has your experience prepared you for this position?,"My life is one of public service, and giving back to the community where I have now lived longer than any other is why I first volunteered for the West Richland Planning Commission and, later, successfully ran for City Council in 2017. My professional work experience includes six years military service in the U.S. Navy, 25 years as a special agent-of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and 10 years as the counterintelligence Program manager at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Further, I am the current president of the Association of Washington Cities, representing the 281 cities and towns in our state, and a member of the governor’s Forensic Investigations Council, our state’s Emergency Management Council and the Benton County Law and Justice Council.

As an experienced and proven manager at the federal, state, and city levels, and a widely endorsed candidate by other elected leaders, civic and labor organizations, I am the best qualified candidate for mayor.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70986777
Fred Brink,West Richland Mayor,West Richland,1,What is your record of public service?,"As discussed above, public service spans my entire life. The most challenging positions I’ve held include being the Special Agent-in-Charge for the FBI in the State of Mississippi, with oversight of all staff, facilities, investigations and operations within the state, for which I received the U.S. Attorney’s Award for outstanding leadership in criminal investigations. Another demanding assignment was as the FBI’s Legal Attache at the United States Embassy, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. There I directed all operations of an international FBI office serving five Middle East nations. My results were recognized with the award of the FBI Investigative Excellence Medal for outstanding leadership and achievements. Finally, after the 9/11 terror attacks in New York City, I played an integral part in establishing the emergency command center for the FBI’s New York Office and I also oversaw evidence collection activities at the World Trade Center “Ground Zero” site.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70986777
Fred Brink,West Richland Mayor,West Richland,2,Why did you decide to run for this position?,"As a councilmember and mayor pro tem for West Richland with eight years of service on city council, I chose to run for mayor when our current mayor decided not to seek re-election. Further, my education, background and decades of experience in a wide range of challenging positions at all levels of government and in our local community should greatly benefit West Richland in my service as mayor for our city.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70986777
Fred Brink,West Richland Mayor,West Richland,3,What are the three major issues facing your city/town?,"The most important issues facing West Richland include our high property taxes, maintaining our parks and roads, enhancing public safety and our policing capability, and sensibly managing our city’s growth. With limited sales tax revenue and higher property assessments, property taxes have increased tremendously and represent a serious concern for our citizens.  West Richland’s parks and roads have a significant amount of deferred maintenance which must be addressed. In addition, our police officer staffing must be increased, and our city’s rapid growth must be responsible managed.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70986777
Fred Brink,West Richland Mayor,West Richland,4,How do you plan to address these issues?,"Addressing these issues requires increased general fund revenue which may be obtained through a range of strategies, such as Public-Private Partnerships, leveraging underutilized assets, and pursuing federal, state, and local grants. These actions may also introduce innovative solutions and operational efficiencies from the private sector.

What is NOT needed is changing West Richland’s form of government, as advocated by some. Our present Mayor-Council government serves West Richland well and changing to a manager-council form of government will create a huge expense for our citizens. Further, a manager, likely chosen from outside our city, does not know the area and may leave the city when offered a higher salary in another community, creating a leadership void. Most importantly, city managers are not directly accountable to the voters as our separately elected mayor is. West Richland citizens have no desire to give up their right to choose who serves as our city’s chief executive.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70986777

Warren Hughs,Kennewick City Council Ward 3,Kennewick,3,How do you think your city/town should respond to homelessness?,"Homelessness is a difficult challenge it involves Federal, State, County, and City jurisdictions and laws. While I personally believe the solution to homelessness lies in addressing the root causes that put our citizens on the streets.

 I understand that there are many limitations to what the City alone can do to address the root causes of homelessness. As a Representative of Kennewick's 3rd its important to communicate with our first responders to identify and prioritize the needs that the City Council can address directly and work to reach out to our partners in County and State government to collaboratively address needs outside the authority of the City Council.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=24925299

Pat Holten,Richland City Council Position 3,Richland,0,How do you plan on interacting with the citizens of your city?,"Having lived in Richland for over 50 years and been involved in a wide range of community activities, I already have deep connections with many residents. As a city council member, I would clearly identify myself in that role and make it a priority to attend public events like Alive at Five, Art in the Park, and neighborhood meetings—not just to be present, but to actively introduce myself and ask people how they feel things are going in the city. I believe in being visible and approachable. I live in a central, well-traveled area of Richland, and I’ve already made my contact information public so that people can easily reach out. My goal is to be a council member people feel comfortable talking to—whether it’s sharing an idea, voicing a concern, or just having a conversation.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=25059066
Pat Holten,Richland City Council Position 3,Richland,1,What should your city/town’s role be in dealing with environmental issues?,"The City of Richland must be a leader in protecting our environment while growing wisely. Having lived here for over 50 years, I value our riverfront, parks, and greenbelts—key to our quality of life. I support practices that reduce waste, protect air and water, and promote clean, affordable transportation. This includes more efficient bus routes to Hanford, PNNL, WSU, and the airport, as well as walkable and bike-friendly neighborhoods. Growth must be thoughtful—preserving green space and neighborhood character. I strongly support clean nuclear energy and new reactor development here in Richland. Environmental concerns also affect public safety, homelessness, and health. We need collaboration with local agencies, and we must involve residents in clean-up efforts, maintenance, and stewardship. Environmental progress must be practical, inclusive, and benefit the entire community. As a council member, I will advocate for policies that protect our natural beauty and build a healthy future",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=25059066
Pat Holten,Richland City Council Position 3,Richland,2,What is your record of public service?,"Over the years, I’ve been actively involved in Richland’s schools through PTA, and by supporting sports and music programs while raising my three children. I’ve also used my background in music to give back by performing in assisted living centers, hospitals, restaurants, and at community events. Politically, I’ve supported good local leadership by recruiting candidates and working on campaigns behind the scenes. I believe good governance begins at the local level with capable, informed people willing to serve. My church involvement has included music and serving on the benevolence committee, helping meet needs in both the congregation and the broader community. Whether through education, civic engagement, music, or acts of compassion, I’ve always believed in stepping forward to serve—and I bring that same spirit of service to my candidacy for Richland City Council.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=25059066
Pat Holten,Richland City Council Position 3,Richland,3,How do you think your city/town should respond to homelessness?,"Homelessness is a complex issue that must be addressed with both compassion and common sense. Providing housing without expectations is not a long-term solution. Many labeled “homeless” have families who want to help but are blocked by untreated addiction, mental illness, or refusal of support. I know families heartbroken by this reality. Solutions must address root causes—not just offer shelter. I support Benton County’s plan to convert the former Kennewick hospital into a facility that combines housing with mental health and addiction services. This coordinated care model helps people move forward, not just shift locations. At the same time, we must preserve the safety and livability of our community. Public spaces must remain safe, and crime cannot be excused as a symptom of homelessness. Addressing this issue requires cooperation from city and county government, law enforcement, mental health providers, and nonprofits. With shared effort, we can serve both people and community well",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=25059066
Pat Holten,Richland City Council Position 3,Richland,4,How would you describe your vision for your city?,"My vision for Richland is a community that grows wisely—preserving what makes it special while planning carefully for the future. Our older, walkable neighborhoods are a great asset, allowing people to walk to stores, parks, and services. I want to protect that livability and work toward creating similar walkable, connected communities in newer parts of the city. With Richland’s rapid growth, we must provide housing and services without overwhelming existing neighborhoods. That means smart development with attention to traffic, safety, schools, parks, and access to shopping—building neighborhoods, not just subdivisions. I also support continued improvement of our waterfront, balancing recreation and environmental protection so all generations can enjoy the river. Richland must remain a place where people feel connected—to each other, to nature, and to opportunity. Supporting good jobs in agriculture, nuclear energy, and science at PNNL is key to our economic and environmental future.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=25059066
Austin Miller,Kennewick City Council Ward 1,Kennewick,0,How do you plan on interacting with the citizens of your city?,"It is important to meet people where they are. People are busy, and it’s easy to forget about the city council—unless it’s in the news for some kind of scandal. I think it’s part of the job to remind people that we are here for them.

Open meetings are a good start, but we can also do more to prioritize outreach. This may look like more social media involvement or canvassing of neighborhoods. I’ve learned that candidates can be really good at knocking on doors when they are running for office, but less enthusiastic during the rest of the term when the goal is to get information about the council to or from the community.

We should also encourage more people to be involved—not just those that stand to gain personally or financially. It’s the job of the city council to inspire the people we serve, be a champion of shared values, and cultivate the desire that people have to support each other.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70744611
Austin Miller,Kennewick City Council Ward 1,Kennewick,1,What should your city/town’s role be in dealing with environmental issues?,"The biggest environmental issues facing us right now may be the toxic algae blooms and PFAs in our groundwater. We should continue to work with other cities and counties to do what we can in terms of mitigation.

Like many concerns, these are things that originated largely outside of our city. To protect our residents, we will need to identify the sources of the contamination. They likely made profits from production, and our people are currently paying the costs. We should do what we can to ensure that those responsible—if even accidently—use some of those profits to support cleanup. We can also petition state and federal governments when necessary, to better regulate businesses with harmful side effects.

Similarly, the decisions we make here may affect others outside of our city. Walkability-focused development may help to mitigate the effects that our cars have on the global environment. More walkability also means less traffic congestion and more opportunities for small businesses",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70744611
Austin Miller,Kennewick City Council Ward 1,Kennewick,2,What is your record of public service?,"I have always been the type of person to say yes when asked for volunteers. Even in fifth grade, I joined the orchestra because they needed someone to play the bass. This attitude has given many chances to learn new skills and to serve. I participated in student leadership in high school and college, planning social events to make sure everyone felt included and serving as treasurer for a student council election. When my kid’s soccer team needed a coach, I stepped in and had a great time.

During my career as an analyst, I served on a healthcare think tank, helped support social media campaigns that were important to me, and provided unpaid economic analysis to engineering projects. I’ve also served on several committees as a teacher including curriculum development, local business support, diversity and inclusion, student affairs, and research ethics.

This year, when I saw a need in our city council, I also said yes. And I’m excited for this new opportunity to serve the city I love.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70744611
Austin Miller,Kennewick City Council Ward 1,Kennewick,3,How do you think your city/town should respond to homelessness?,"Most problems can be solved with more funding, but that is also the one thing that is hardest to come by. As an analyst, I do have a lot of experience finding ways to stretch budgets and use funds more efficiently. But we also need to be open to creative solutions that better use the resources we already have.

With respect to homelessness, I know we are involved in county-level committees that are doing good work in terms of housing opportunities, health services, and drug treatment alternatives. But I’m confident that we can do more.

We should start by inviting people who are experiencing homelessness to participate in the conversation. We should ask them what they need from us, and carefully listen to what they say. We also need to work to remove the stigma of homelessness. Not having a place to live is not a moral failing. It is a challenge that we must face together with compassion and respect.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70744611
Austin Miller,Kennewick City Council Ward 1,Kennewick,4,How would you describe your vision for your city?,"We’re familiar with the old African proverb that says it takes a village to raise a child. It turns out that it takes a village to do a lot more than that. It takes a village to find work-life balance, to help each other learn about new issues with patience and without bias, to find time and energy for growth, and celebration, and art.

National news makes it seem like we have a lot to fight over, but I believe we have more in common than we have disagreements. We all want a safe place for our kids to thrive. We want economic stability. We want to feel loved, accepted, and able to follow our dreams.

Politics and economics don’t have to be about winners and losers. We can work together to support local businesses and side gigs, and build a future Kennewick intentionally focused on modern, responsible growth. I envision a Kennewick that makes room for all of our residents and ensures that the best opportunities are available to as many people as possible.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70744611

David Cole,West Richland City Council Position 3,West Richland,3,How do you think your city/town should respond to homelessness?,"This is a serious public safety issue.  Enacting policies that prevent the enabling of behaviors associated with homelessness is the biggest and first step toward addressing the issue.  The heart of the homelessness issue is substance abuse/addiction, mental health issues, and usually both.  Homelessness is a symptom of that – no one in their right mind lives on the street as a way of life.  Needle exchange programs, warming shelters and similar policies are inhumane insofar as they enable dangerous behaviors which contribute to crime and put the public at risk.  I strongly believe that addressing the drug and mental health issues in the community will virtually eliminate “homelessness” as we know it.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70986759

There are also two scheduled times on every city council meeting agenda where citizens can directly address council.  Council meetings are held at City Hall at 6pm on every 1st and 3rd Tuesday evenings. There are times when council is advised to not directly address questions from the public to avoid liability on issues that may involve potential contracts or legal actions.  In these cases council is asked by the city administration to refer citizens to our clerk, mayor, or attorney.  But in general, if a response is requested, council members can write back to a citizen, or answer their questions publicly at the next council meeting.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70986745

I will continue to support funding that maintains the pristine environment that West Richland residents enjoy.  I will watch for any industries that may intend to pollute our ground, water, or air.  Our rural and peaceful suburban environment is also a characteristic that I want to protect through careful planning that does not force the “15-minute city” style of development.  I would prefer to see West Richland duplicate the experience residents currently enjoy; while also encouraging commercial centers for future retail and light industrial development. I support the inclusion of “green space” (even if it is just natural desert with a trail) in between developments.

John Smart,West Richland City Council Position 1,West Richland,3,How do you think your city/town should respond to homelessness?,"Homelessness is largely due to drug use, spiritual illness, and associated unemployment or underemployment.  It is important to maintain policies that forbid panhandling and encampments.  Our City can help by maintaining a business friendly environment that minimizes impediments to business so that jobs stay abundant at every level.  City governments are incorporated to serve the basic municipal needs of its citizens.  Water, Sewer, Roads, Electricity, Waste Disposal, and Law Enforcement are the reasons that citizens allow taxes to be collected.  The City should ensure that private and non-profit efforts to provide charity and assistance to those in need are uninhibited by restrictive ordinances or regulations.  I support a wide range of home development options from townhouses to mini-farms and everything in between.  Only ~7 acres of continuous high density apartment complexes should be developed in one area. Acres of lower density lots must buffer between them.

John Smart,West Richland City Council Position 1,West Richland,4,How would you describe your vision for your city?,"I want West Richland to look like “Freedom!”  Property owners and businesses should be free to develop their interests as they see fit – as long as they do not infringe on their neighbor’s right to enjoy their property. The hidden expense of an over- regulated approach to community development creates a wide-spread and perpetual economic cost. I do not favor the “15 minute City” “Form Based Code” design approach that is currently being pushed. A city of 18,000 people must concentrate on: Water, Sewer, Roads, Electricity, Waste Disposal, and Law Enforcement.  I support current parks and new neighborhood parks that are sponsored by corporate trusts, private trust funds, or neighborhood organizations. We welcome small and large business while maintaining the rural and quiet suburban living that our residents cherish. My vision supports Equine Environments, backyard chickens, and a city where children can play on sidewalks and ride their bicycles around neighborhoods without fear of crime.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70986745

Pasco has made progress with shelter space and outreach programs, but we must do more.

We need to hold people accountable while identifying where the city can step in with structured options like organized encampments or designated areas for overnight parking. The new Columbia Valley Recovery Center will be a major asset, but we must ensure people get the help they need instead of living on our streets.

For the past 10 years I have worked at WSU as a historian and archivist for the Hanford History Project.  Hanford is a complex and complicated site to interpret and in that work I balance different ideological perspectives to present an accurate depection of the past.

Support teachers and students in our classrooms, especially in schools with high numbers of low-income students and ESL students (and parents).

Parents need a board who recognizes their efforts at home and their represents their opinions in decision-making.

Achieving student success means supporting hardworking education professionals.  I'm proud to have teacher union support because as an educator I know why we show up every day.  I know the joy and frustration and I wouldn't want to do anything else with my life - I love education.  But teachers need good working enviornments - teachers’ working conditions are students’ learning conditions.

School bus safety is also important and ensuring that our buses have effective security is as important as the school buildings. 
School districts also have a responsibility to ensure the mental and emotional safety of students along with their physical well-being. School Boards can play an important role in this by establishing and maintaining a broad policy that is inclusive and makes students feel like they belong in their schools.

The second challenge is our budget and the need to responsibly rebuild reserves to 5% without cutting vital programs or staff. The board has adopted a four-year plan that reduces costs through attrition rather than layoffs, protecting classrooms and student services. Finally, passing the local levy is critical.

For the first time, our superintendent is held accountable for measurable growth in student learning. In addition, the board has directed the superintendent to strengthen early identification systems for students who are struggling and to put interventions in place sooner. We also required continued monitoring of students at risk of not graduating so they receive support earlier, before falling too far behind.

I bring both institutional knowledge and practical financial insight that will help guide the district toward sustainable and responsible decision-making.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70970562
Steve Christensen,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,1,"What, in your opinion, are the three most pressing issues facing your school district currently?","Budget, budget, and budget. While there are other important issues, the district’s financial situation is the most urgent. In the 2024–25 school year, the district spent nearly $10 million more than budgeted. The current budget also projects $5 million more in expenditures than revenues. This is not sustainable. Addressing the budget shortfall must be a top priority to ensure we can continue delivering quality education without jeopardizing the district’s financial stability.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70970562
Steve Christensen,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,2,How would you respond to the issue you consider the most important?,"The board must work closely with the superintendent to find ways to reduce expenses while maintaining an effective educational program. This will require collaboration among the board, staff, and community. Tough decisions will need to be made, and not everyone will agree with every choice. However, these steps are necessary to restore fiscal balance and protect the district’s future. I am willing to do that work and make the responsible decisions required.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70970562
Steve Christensen,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,3,How can you ensure the safety of all students in your schools?,"Student safety is one of the district’s highest priorities. In recent years, steps have been taken to make school buildings more secure from external threats. Going forward, we must ensure that safety protocols and processes are in place, effective, and consistently followed. As a board member, I will advocate for regular reviews, updates, and accountability measures to ensure our schools remain safe environments for all students and staff.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70970562
Steve Christensen,Pasco School Board District 3,Pasco,4,"How would you work to balance the needs and interests of students, teachers, and parents within the school district?","When I previously served on the board, we prioritized listening to the community. That must continue. With budget challenges ahead, decisions will have real impacts on students, families, and staff. As a board member, I will make active listening and community engagement central to the decision-making process. The board has a responsibility to keep the public informed and to seek their input, and I will make that a priority to ensure balanced, transparent governance.",en,https://www.vote411.org/ballot?lwv-ballot-widget-raceid=70970562
