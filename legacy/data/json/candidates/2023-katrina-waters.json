Team treasurer for soccer team.  \n  \n**Statement**  \nI am a mother of 3 RSD graduates, a leader in my profession, and a volunteer youth leader. I believe we can find common ground through mutual respect and understanding to increase the Boardâ€™s effectiveness and direct the district in delivering the best education for our youth. As a Board member, I will work to ensure that RSD meets the needs of all students and staff, ensure fiscal responsibility, lobby for sufficient funding and effective use of taxpayer money. My priorities are supporting our educational mandates including special education, the physical safety and mental health of students and staff, and improving communication and collaboration between stakeholders. I have found success as a leader in a large Richland-based research organization and on advisory boards for multiple federal agencies by confronting unfunded mandates, competing priorities, and mission creep through accountability and collaboration with very diverse sets of perspectives and values. My decade of service to youth programs (Scouts BSA, sports) and personal experience with the school system also prepare me to serve the community through the RSD Board. I am committed to find unity in the Board with accountability and transparency to effectively support our children, our staff and our community.",
