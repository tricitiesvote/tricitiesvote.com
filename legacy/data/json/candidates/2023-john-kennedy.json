I am running for re-election to the Pasco School Board to continue serving as an advocate for them and their families. Our Board can only be effective if its members work together and make decisions as one through consensus. That is my approach as a Board Director. \n\nAs a college instructor with 13 years experience, I understand the importance of ensuring our students have the educational tools necessary to thrive in a competitive economy. I will continue to partner with Board colleagues and District staff to support strong Career and Technical Education programs and advocate for equitably providing students STEM career development opportunities. Our students have clearly expressed to us their need for meaningful connections with their community and true feeling of belonging in their schools. Maintaining Board support for robust and sustainable physical, social, and emotional wellness for our students will remain a high priority of mine. \n\nI will always listen to parents, students, staff, and educators when establishing policy and equitably allocating resources for all of our students and schools in a fiscally responsible way. I humbly ask for your vote. Thank you.",
