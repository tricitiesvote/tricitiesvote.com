Our city benefits from great schools, beautiful parks, and a rich culture of diverse worldviews and experiences. To support our growth and build a brighter future, I advocate for innovative solutions for safer neighbors, improving local economy, and developing infrastructure.\n\nRichland’s rapid growth calls for responsible management to ensure that all of our community benefits from the improved economy.
