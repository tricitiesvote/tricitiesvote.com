As a board member, I have used this information to inform my decisions for ALL students.  \n  \n  \n\nI believe the parent/guardian has the ultimate say in their child’s education. Students with good parental/guardian involvement are more academically and emotionally successful.   The board's responsibility is setting policy and direction to ensure that ALL students are represented to reach their full potential in an environment that meets their specific needs.  My core values include mental health, special education, academic success, transparency, accountability, fiscal responsibility, and local control.\n\nMy experience, willingness to listen, objectivity, and open-mindedness will help lead the district to set high standards in education for ALL kids. We have the leadership, staff, and community to give our students what they need to be happy, successful contributing members of any community.  I am asking for your support in re-electing me to share my passion and commitment to representing ALL students in Richland School District.\n\nContact:  509-546-1303 Email: Jill4RSD@gmail.com",
