My blended family of five children and seven grandchildren choose to reside here, and they propel my deep commitment to this community.\n\nFor me, it is vital that I listen to our community and lead with conviction to ensure decisions and actions reflect its collective values. I have over 30 years of volunteer service as I truly believe in service above self; and leading by example is my legacy for family and community. I bring this same dedication to my Port of Benton position.\n\nAs the incumbent, I champion our economic development and our daily efforts to maintain and develop our current industry-base, while actively recruiting new industries. We must remain laser-focused on retaining affordable power rates with reliable, baseload sustainable “all the above” energy generation and this demands relentless advocacy of our hydropower generating dams.\n\nAs commissioner, it’s essential that I support the hiring and retention of highly capable and dedicated staff who expertly collaborate with cities, counties, tribes and government agencies to execute the Port of Benton’s mission in our community.\n\nWe are better together!",
