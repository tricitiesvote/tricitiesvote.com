I believe in giving back to my community and it would be an honor and privilege to continue to serve the citizens of Kennewick.\n\nEconomic development is key to our community and should continue as a central consideration in city council decisions. The City of Kennewick has an Apprenticeship Utilization agreement that supports the use of local apprentices on specific public works projects. Developing an infrastructure that attracts new business and sustains existing business will continue to promote job creation and employ and train our local workforce. Quality of life improvements and safety are vitally important to our community. Building a strong economic environment and strengthening community partnerships creates opportunities to thrive personally, professionally, financially, and culturally.\n\nAs a former Hanford employee and current community leader, I have spent a lifetime building relationships with people from all corners of our community, bringing diverse interests together to solve challenges through listening, collaboration, and hard work. I am “Personally Invested in Your Community” and respectfully ask for the opportunity to continue to serve you.\n\nFacebook: MillbauerforKennewick; Instagram: MillbauerforKennewick",
