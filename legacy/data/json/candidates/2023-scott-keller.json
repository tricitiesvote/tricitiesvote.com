The Port provides jobs, attracts businesses to our region, and helps small businesses thrive and grow to become successful contributors to our economy.\n\nOne of my top priorities as commissioner will be to get the Port’s focus back to supporting small business development. By working closely with local Government partners, we can create a business-friendly environment that encourages growth and innovation.\n\nAs commissioner I will ensure the Port operates in a transparent and accountable manner. We need to make the best decisions possible on where all our tax dollars are being spent.\n\nFinally, I believe that it is important to protect the natural resources that make our region so special. I will work to ensure that the Port operates in an environmentally responsible manner, and that we take steps to minimize our impacts wherever possible. I am committed to working collaboratively with my fellow commissioners, Port staff, and the community to achieve these goals. I am dedicated to serving our community and would be honored to have your support this November.",
