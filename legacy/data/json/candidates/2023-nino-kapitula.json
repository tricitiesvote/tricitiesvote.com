My mother sought a better life for her daughters and brought us to the United States when I was 13. I now have school age children; I care about our schools. My mother showed me how a dream for a better future and hard work leads to success. I will promote schools that are willing to put in the work so our children receive the skills and academics they need for success.\n\nWashington parents are faced with fear for their childrenâ€™s future. We should have the right to know what is being taught in the classroom, fully transparent about teaching and learning materials. We should have the right to speak up when we disagree. I will work to close the gap between parents and teachers to rebuild a broken trust. I know what freedom is, I know how to work hard, and I love this country in all its diversity. \n\nChildren are the future! Let us stand united in raising Bright Children for a Bright Future!  \n  \n  \n\nEndorsed by Benton County Republican Party",
