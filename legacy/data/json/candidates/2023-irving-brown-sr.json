I have lived in Pasco since 2008 and serve as Human Resources Manager at Oasis Farms in Prosser, WA.\n\n  \nPasco stands at a crossroads. With a booming population, we are facing important decisions about planning to manage this future growth wisely. Our economy remains one of the fastest growing in the state, which is attracting more people; this is an opportunity for an even brighter future for this city. I am running because I firmly believe in Pasco and the promise of that future while continuing work on our long-term plans.  \n  \n\nIf elected, I will continue strengthening our city’s economy with pro-growth policies and planning that will encourage development evenly across our city. I will promote ways to save money in our budget without compromising vital services. I want to maintain a culture of equity, inclusion, and empowerment in our local government. We can uphold that culture by restoring the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee.\n\nLet’s build our future together. I respectfully ask for your vote.
