            Our issue matrix is based on real issues candidates will faceâ€”not 
            talking points. The prompts have imperfect tradeoffs because real decisions
            rarely give you perfect options.{' '}

            We invite every candidate to participate and we give them the chance to 
            add additional comments to explain their positions.
